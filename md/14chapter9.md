**Abstract**

The benefits of the information society come at the price of increasing
data dependency. This creates tensions between economic, privacy, and
public security interests. While data fuels the digital economy and
production of cross-border value, it also affects power relations
between states and other actors. In response, data localization policies
have emerged addressing data flows in the context of information
sovereignty. This chapter unfolds the basic concept of data localization
and outlines how the underlying policy objectives correspond within the
WTO framework. It further examines the principles of data regulation
drawing on the nature of information and its lifecycles. The chapter
concludes with a mapping tool for data localization policies and moves
towards the analytical framework for data regulation.

## Introduction

Data has a location and its regulation matters. Whether data constitutes
paper records collecting dust on a shelf, or electronic records embedded
in a database, it is physically stored somewhere. In a data dependent
society, the governance of data and specifically its physical
infrastructure is critically important as they are the basis of all
activities, particularly which take place in virtual reality. No
services provided in cyberspace (e.g. messengers, online video games or
cloud storage) can work without servers maintained in the real world.

However, the whole architecture of storing data while providing services
is invisible to users and is therefore seen as a technical matter.[^09chapter9_2]
Nonetheless, depending on the regulatory model, physical infrastructure
might affect social welfare in one way or another. This is evident in
the emerging fight for allocation and redistribution of data among
storage facilities in various jurisdictions. One of the tools states use
in this struggle is data localization (DL) -- the reason why LinkedIn
stopped operating in Russia, Apple is opening data centers in China and
moving encryption keys onshore, and Microsoft wallowed in disputes with
the US Government.[^09chapter9_3]

States have been utilizing the localization of technology and
information as a policy tool for years.[^09chapter9_4] When states adopted privacy
and data protection regulations in the 1970s, scholars began analyzing
the possibility of data privacy and international laws colliding.[^09chapter9_5]
The discussion eventually recognized important international trade
issues: data is foundational to most business interactions, meaning that
limiting data flows directly affects trade.[^09chapter9_6] However, little
attention has been paid to the variety of DL regulations and how such
variety affects the end results of regulatory policies.

To keep up with the social and business expectations and practices the
DL discussion has to transform.[^09chapter9_7] Designing smart data regulations and
calibrating DL is necessary given the dependency of the global community
on data. However, this is impossible unless we consider the diverse
kinds of information and the different regulatory goals that states seek
to achieve through controlling information. Thus, DL is not a single,
uniform policy measure that always has the same positive or negative
consequences; it all depends on what DL measure is adopted. If
regulators fail to make DL measures that are fair and just, they risk
causing conflict, whether at domestic or international levels.

This chapter explains the essence of DL policies, including the basic
goals they seek to achieve. It reviews DL policy taxonomies and explains
their limitations. Then, it outlines the tensions between privacy,
information sovereignty and international trade in the context of the
World Trade Organization (WTO). Against this background, it examines the
role of information management cycles (IMCs) and regulatory principles
in data regulation. This allows the final analysis that maps DL policies
and provides insights into how DL features such as storage location and
technological implementation could affect the output of DL policy --
providing the key analytical framework for crafting data regulations
that avoid negative consequences. While mapping is not a new theory, it
is the analytical framework that should initiate the transition from DL
taxonomical description to data policy evaluation, modelling and
projection.

## What is Data Localization? 

The term *data localization* refers to compulsory legal requirements to
store data in a specific territory. This broad concept is implemented in
a myriad of laws and regulations.[^09chapter9_8]

DL policy aims to achieve multiple social goals and potentially may
disrupt the informational environment, where agents interact and
contribute to improvement of social welfare.[^09chapter9_9] This is due to
conceptual labyrinth where states are forced to regulate the use of
technologies that facilitate universal human rights, promote economic
activities and enhance national security, despite the way that these
values can come into conflict. Encrypted apps such as Telegram and Zello
are the examples of technological progress reaching twofold results. On
one hand, they protect privacy and globally improve welfare; on the
other they raise national security issues by limiting opportunities to
enforce domestic legislation regarding users and their own
activities.[^09chapter9_10]

DL practices continuously evolve and have drawn wide attention of
scholars in the last few years. There have been several taxonomies of DL
practices that are substantively different, but similar in descriptive
approach.[^09chapter9_11] Broad measures embrace as much data as possible, while
narrow DL measures can specify particular sets of data or particular
businesses that are obliged to localize data.[^09chapter9_12] On a broad approach
DL measures could be defined as any measures that affect cross-border
data transfer. Further, they could be grouped by the forms of
implementation: (i) rules prohibiting overseas data transfers; (ii)
rules restricting overseas data transfers by authorization; (iii) rules
requiring *per se* localization of data; (iv) taxes on data export.[^09chapter9_13]
Such classification is not exhaustive. It could be supplemented at least
with two additional types of DL: (v) disclosure of cryptographic keys;
and (vi) obligatory disclosure of the requested information by entities
subject to a particular jurisdiction regardless of the storage
location.[^09chapter9_14] Relying on the broad approach scholars also distinguish
two more categories of DL measures by distinguishing between different
technological means of implementation. Thus, states invoke policies of
localized data hosting (e.g. sole or local copy) and localized data
routing (e.g. data packets routing through the designated routes).[^09chapter9_15]
Such state interventions in data traffic are usually ensured by
cooperation with internet service providers such as content filtering
(censorship), access control (website blocking) and regulation of
privacy enhancing technologies such as virtual private networks.[^09chapter9_16] On
the narrow approach to DL, there are three types of DL measures: (i)
requirements to store *all* data in facilities located inside of the
state; (ii) requirements to store *specific* sets of data in facilities
located inside of the state; and (iii) requirements to transfer data
only to states with adequate legislative and security measures in place
with particular purposes and for a limited time.[^09chapter9_17]

Whatever particular DL measures are taken, they may be seen as
information barriers,[^09chapter9_18] as they can limit information flows in
various ways within the infosphere or specifically within a particular
political agent like a state or economic union.[^09chapter9_19] DL makes access to
localized data harder for some agents and increases the informational
gap between them, while strengthening privacy and information
sovereignty protection. However, DL is not only about building
informational walls to exclude access of external agents, because the
data also becomes more accessible for agents in the jurisdiction to
which it is localized. Hence, DL can be a tool for preventing or
facilitating access to information, depending on how it is used.

Before proceeding to examine and evaluate possible DL outcomes, it will
be necessary to understand the legal and policy problems that arise from
the tension between the three concepts that provided grounds for DL in
the first place.

## Localization Tensions: Privacy - Data Sovereignty - International Trade 

DL raises theoretical and practical issues on many levels. First, there
is the issue of individual privacy, in particular the desire to protect
personal (identifiable) information (PII) from others. Privacy over PII
is the ability 'to determine [...] when, how, and to what extent
information about [...] [*individuals, groups, institutions*] is
communicated to others'.[^09chapter9_20] Second, states as independent agents
interact with individuals as well as other states. They also have an
interest in protecting and accessing information that has value to them.
Thus, a notion of data sovereignty arises, which in fact is very similar
to individuals' privacy in terms of guarding data of a critical
importance by an independent agent. Finally, DL policy affects the free
use of information in markets including cross-border trade, where an
agenda to liberalize trade by reducing restrictions on imports and
exports prevails.

These layers are inter-dependent. Privacy determines not only personal
security, but also state security (e.g. consider a Twitter bot that is
tracking movements of top public officials,[^09chapter9_21] a fitness app exposing
military bases,[^09chapter9_22] a security breach exposing records of active
military).[^09chapter9_23] In turn, data sovereignty provides both individual and
institutional data protection (e.g. in 2007 the government of Estonia
had to cut off the country from the outside internet in order to stop a
cyber-attack and prevent possible data loss).[^09chapter9_24] International trade
therefore has an interface with domestic and international regulation of
privacy as well as rules regarding the use of state information (e.g.
requirements established for activities related to critical information
infrastructure).[^09chapter9_25]

Consequently, problems arise where information restrictions provided by
the first two layers start to compete between each other and conflict
with international obligations established by the third. In particular,
the WTO covered agreements[^09chapter9_26] establish the most inclusive liberalized
trade regime in the world by requiring non-discrimination and
predictable market access.[^09chapter9_27] Nonetheless, WTO members frequently
restrict non-discrimination obligations and market access for foreign
goods and services and this includes restrictions on data flows.[^09chapter9_28]
Under trade rules, DL measures might constitute a type of non-tariff
barrier in digital trade, which might affect trade in services, goods
and intellectual property (IP) or constitute a technical barrier to
trade. However, none of the legal issues raised by DL implementation
have been tested before the WTO dispute resolution body, and therefore
the application of the WTO rules (about which there are different
interpretations in existing disputes) remains a matter of debate.[^09chapter9_29]

In theory the WTO regime should provide certainty and predictability of
international trade, but currently it does not do so in relation to data
flows. Data usage falls under numerous legal categories and the WTO
Agreement provides various exceptions for legitimate non-compliance to
achieve goals such as the protection of individuals' privacy.[^09chapter9_30] Such
protection has to be related to PII processing and dissemination.
Another exception is focused on states' safety, which in turn can mean
many things. There is also a general exception concerning public order,
which applies in the event of a 'genuine and sufficiently serious threat
to important societal values'.[^09chapter9_31] Finally, states could purport to
rely on a security exception which permits to impose any measures that
they consider necessary in time of emergency in international relations.
States with DL regulation may claim any of these broad exceptions as
justification for protecting data sovereignty. Although these matters
(particularly, the DL measure's necessity to achieve the goal) arise
under the WTO regime and therefore they should be resolved accordingly
by means of treaties interpretation and their application to particular
facts, one inevitably will face a dilemma of weighing importance of
societal values.

In assessing various state DL measures' compliance with WTO obligations,
one will ask the following long-standing questions. Is privacy more
important than national security? Is it vice versa? Should cross-border
data flows be enforced to ensure international trade in any event at the
expense of these values? How does one determine the balance between
several societal values? How should regulatory practices look to reach
and preserve such a balance? In the end of the day, do DL measures serve
data justice within a complex multi-agent system? Do they amount to
smart and fair data regulation? These kinds of questions cannot and
should not be answered solely in context of the existing law.[^09chapter9_32]
Consequently, we should look beyond that to other approaches that may
provide guidance.

## Regulating Information Management Cycles

Rapid datafication consisting of data computerization and reevaluation
has sparked the discussion of data power and its connection to social
justice.[^09chapter9_33] This gave rise to the idea of data justice -- an ethical
guide for information society and the basis of data regulation. Data
justice being a fairly new phenomenon is the subject of research within
various fields of study.[^09chapter9_34] The notion of data justice reflects on
data governance and its effects on social and economic justice. Data
justice in the context of DL policing highlights the role of data within
the tripartite power relations between individuals, states and
international institutions explained above. In other words, data justice
is the pursuit of fair data use by agents aimed at corporate and state
surveillance, privacy protection and free data flows for the purpose of
economic and technological development. This chapter posits that data
justice and hence smart data regulation analysis should take into
account the variety of regulatory institutions concerning data such as
PII and IP in all their numerous forms, and efficient information
lifecycle management consisting of generation, collection, storage,
processing, distribution, usage, and erasure as a coherent system
because the regulatory system is the foundation of any kind of justice
and contemporary society is not only driven by information but also
depends on it to function properly.[^09chapter9_35]

Current research has been limited by the binary constraints of
traditional regulatory approaches that currently characterize the
discussion of the balance between private and public interests regarding
the treatment of IMCs (i.e. ensuring data justice). This prevents the
elaboration of satisfactory solutions that can maintain complex
multi-level systems such as DL. Hence, it is necessary to overcome such
limitations.

Conceptually it is reasonable to assume that, depending on the
particular structure of a DL policy, a measure could serve one or more
policy goals by countless means. At the same time, such means should be
analyzed as whole since one small detail could determine the output of
the system. For instance, would a measure fully depriving individuals of
their autonomy to guard data serve the purpose of privacy protection?
How does a DL system technically incapable of enforcing a law -- or
prone to over-enforcement -- contribute to serving data justice and
account for necessity? Mapping DL practices should help answer these
questions.

Any data regulatory practice should be evaluated on the basis of how it
affects the well-being of agents and the informational environment. Any
decrease in size or corrosion of quality of information will cause the
infosphere to shrink in terms of content, forms and patterns.[^09chapter9_36] This
leads to fewer opportunities for agents to beneficially interact and
thus to contribute to welfare. Hence, the more restrictive DL policy,
the higher the deficit of information and the less space for agents to
communicate. However, it does not mean that information processes should
not be regulated at all. Clearly, such values as privacy, national
security and trade are all important. There have always been certain
types of data and information processes that states rigorously
restricted on domestic and international levels for the benefit of all
agents. But what matters is how states give effect to restrictive
information policies and what the overall output of such regulatory
system is.[^09chapter9_37]

General regulatory principles such as consistency, certainty, effective
implementation, stability, minimization of costs and market distortions,
compatibility with trade facilitation and others are meant to provide
regulators with the framework under which states are more likely to come
up with a better output for the society.[^09chapter9_38] Thus, no society needs a
regulatory mechanism (e.g. regarding theft) that is inconsistent and
impossible to implement because the effect of such regulation tends to
zero, resulting in more risks for the society.

In the context of data, that would mean an unjustified and unnecessary
fracture of the IMCs. Consider the following example. IP is information
identified as a specific category of information, the control of which
is treated by the society in a special way. The Berne Convention
provides regulation for literary works and covers the whole IMC.[^09chapter9_39]
For instance, creation and record are governed by the norms regarding
the form of literary works, publication and formalities (Articles 2, 3,
5); processing and collection are resembled in provisions regarding
derivative works (Article 2); distribution is covered by rules on
reproduction (Article 9); provisions concerning use without charge
regulate information consumption (Article 10); erasure is envisaged by
prescribed moral rights (Article 6*bis*). By over- or non-regulation of
a particular section of the literary work management cycle, the
regulator could break it, eventually resulting in the underproduction of
literary works. This negative effect on generation, dissemination and
consumption of information consequently would affect the state of
welfare.[^09chapter9_40]

This system also demonstrates tensions between private and public
monopoly over information and international obligations. Rephrasing our
previously introduced traditional definition of privacy, we might say
that the 'right to exclude others' in IP is the right to determine when,
how, and to what extent information *created* by individuals, groups or
institutions is communicated to others. States have their own interests
regarding information flows of the category *literary works* and the
Berne Convention provides them with a possibility of legitimate
non-compliance by the right of censorship (Article 17). However, as the
Berne Convention is a unification act and therefore relies on states'
regulatory autonomy and modus of creativity, states independently decide
on how they are going to construct their censorship policy, what
constitutes necessity, to what extent they are willing to sacrifice
regulatory principles in order to reach their objectives. Inevitably,
some regulatory practices will appear better than others.

The same structure applies to DL measures dealing with storage location
and processing of information (which in fact in many cases includes not
only PII, but other categories of information such as IP) that might
result in data injustices and disrupt information lifecycles, thus
making them inefficient. General regulatory principles aimed at
maximizing win-win regulatory end results could therefore provide a
threshold against which it would be possible to compare DL models. The
following section is dedicated to informational construction of DL and
evaluation of regulatory practices.

## Mapping Data Localization Regulatory Practices

DL could be dynamically modelled depending on the chosen regulatory
tools (variables) and their subject matter (types), which in turn
constitute each of the policy goals (observables) (Figure 1). Each
sequence of typed variables uniquely determines the subject matter of
observables and therefore the output of the DL policy.[^09chapter9_41] Such output
in terms of welfare consequences then could be measured against
regulatory principles.

![](imgs/Chapter9_Melashchenko_image1.tiff)
*Figure 1.*

Depending on collection of variables, their types and interpretation it
is possible to construct many variants of DL systems. For instance,
*category* variable determines the scope and thus differently
characterizes observables. Thus, localization of governmental data
should affect the correlation of privacy, sovereignty and trade
differently compared to localization of undefined categories of PII. The
broader the scope, the more it attributes to the protection of privacy
and data sovereignty because data subjects and states acquire more
effective control over data as it is physically available to them.
However, it becomes more burdensome for international trade and domestic
market actors as their economic costs rise as well as more restrictive
on individual liberties because the autonomy to decide the fate of data
shrinks.

Moreover, this relationship depends on the legal form and meaning of the
*types*. For instance, in terms of categories Russia requires the
localization of (i) PII and (ii) communications, while Australia
requires the localization of (iii) personally controlled electronic
health records (PCEHR).[^09chapter9_42] The reason why researchers classify (i) and
(ii) as broad and (iii) as narrow is that they differ in scope and hence
the amount of data required to localize. In Russia PII means any
information that can identify a person. Communications in turn include
metadata and content data or any information transmitted/received by
user over the internet/other means of telecommunications.[^09chapter9_43] On the
other hand, PCEHR constitutes information about and connected to the
customer, which is related to health and recorded in a special system or
register. Obviously, the scope differs considerably depending on the
attributes *any, transmitted,* and *related to health*. The broader the
meaning of a category the more policy space a state acquires in the
course of sovereignty protection. However, it creates uncertainty for
individuals and international market participants that might result in
an overall disadvantage.

Although, this system is not static and the output changes if other
variables are introduced. Thus, for (i) regulated agents include any
persons that are involved in PII management cycle at any stage and
specific entities that ensure communications regarding measure (ii). For
measure (iii), regulated agents are envisaged in the closed list of
entities that are authorized to work with PCEHR. Again, these attributes
make the scope narrower or broader. Further, all measures contain a
non-finite amount of information formats and mediums (e.g. personal and
public records, health records, audio, video, etc.). This attribute
broadens the definition of data for all compared measures.

Such variables as location and method of storage also greatly affect the
output. In case DL mechanism prescribes storage of data in a particular
region or even in a particular datacenter, it creates and worsens to a
degree the so-called jackpot and protected local provider (PLP)
problems.[^09chapter9_44] It is one thing to prescribe storage within a particular
territory thus limiting the market by territory, technical capabilities
and competition, and another if a regulator specifies authorized market
players thus limiting the environment even more. In this regard even
forms of ownership (e.g. public or private) should play a crucial role,
since owners of datacenters and their numbers determine the market.

The enforcement framework matters as well. DL measures are usually
enforced by common regimes of legal sanctions or technical enforcement
such as blocking schemes that preclude service providers from operating
on a particular territory. Just as the wording of a statute makes a
difference in the course of its application, technical characteristics
of the blocking scheme determine the output of a DL measure. For
example, in many instances DL in Russia is based on blocking IP
addresses, while DL in New Zealand is based on blocking of a combination
of IP and URL addresses. Both methods provide different outputs. While
the former is easier and cheaper (this is relevant for those who pay for
such enforcement, e.g. state or internet providers) to implement, it
blocks every resource that is assigned to a blocked IP address, hence
resulting in over-enforcement. The latter on the other hand allows the
conducting of additional filtering by URL and provides for a
precision-guided enforcement mechanism.[^09chapter9_45]

It is important to note that the legal bases for invoking such technical
enforcement are also of a great significance. For example, it is
reasonable to assume that judicial review might reduce possible negative
effects of technical enforcement, particularly regarding IP-based mass
blocking, more effectively if compared to administrative review. On top
of that, the efficiency of these features depends on the meta framework
-- the rule of law. Regardless of how legal and technological
enforcement is formally constructed, in the absence of the rule of law
no mechanism would work properly. This applies to the construction of
any regulation.

The same rationale applies to a feature of localization of encryption
keys, which could be achieved by various means such as compulsory
assistance, lawful hacking and prior design of backdoors.[^09chapter9_46] Each
method has its own advantages and disadvantages but once again it is
crucial to emphasize the importance of legal and technical
implementation frameworks. For instance, compulsory assistance that
implies sending encryption keys over unsecured means of communication is
not better than lawful hacking against an undefined set of persons
without any form of legal review.[^09chapter9_47]

Hence, there is a plethora of elements that at the end of the day may
invoke the law of unintended consequences and turn a DL mechanism
intended to regain control over data for the sake of privacy and
security into something quite the opposite.[^09chapter9_48] It is considerably
difficult to argue that a DL scheme consisting of an obligatory
centralized governmental data storage regarding broad categories of data
and compulsory assistance scheme contributes to privacy protection as
this mechanism clearly erodes individuals' autonomy to determine the
fate of their data. Neither does it amount to reasonable standards of
security protection as such a model elevates jackpot and PLP problems to
a critical level. However, it is only when DL is considered as a complex
system should the output be considered because otherwise policymaking
turns into gambling.[^09chapter9_49]

Based on this could it be reasonably assumed that the Australian measure
is *smarter* because it requires the storage of less data? Or could it
be concluded that all DL measures are bad regulatory practices just
because they establish more burdens? Indeed, either scenario results in
the distortion of IMCs. Consequently, DL measures should be constructed
as to prevent and remove such distortion by adherence to regulatory
principles.

This discussion cannot canvass every link between DL features and
regulatory principles. However, the Australian measure, for instance,
provides more certainty as it raises less questions about what actually
regulated persons ought to store. In contrast, Russian DL measures are
very similar to Russian famous 'yes, no, maybe', which means a negative
reaction of a high uncertainty and possibility to be changed into 'yes'
and 'no' in the future. In other words, it contains a general but not
detailed enough meaning, which is contrary to the principle of legal
certainty. This is the exact reason why experts cannot even agree on
economic consequences because no one knows how much data shall be
stored.[^09chapter9_50]

Overall, such an approach correlates with the precautionary principle
that is familiar to international law including the WTO framework and
many legal systems.[^09chapter9_51] The precautionary principle has emerged as a
response to human activities resulting in environmental degradation and
serves as the basis for safeguarding humans' safety.[^09chapter9_52] However, this
principle may be applied to regulation of inchoate technologies and
therefore IMCs that are constituent to them.[^09chapter9_53]

Generally, the precautionary principle aims at preserving conditions
critical for humans by eliminating potential negative activities that
may alter such conditions even in the absence of a clear and unambiguous
causation.[^09chapter9_54] Indeed, DL policies look like precautionary measures
called to protect states' data sovereignty and individuals' privacy.
However, under this veil data flows are seen as a potential source of
harm and their value (e.g. social, economic, etc.) is often disregarded.
Moreover, such one-sided regulatory interventionism allows for trade
protectionism only worsening localization tensions explained above.
Accordingly, the focus of precautionary protection should also
incorporate IMCs which create the operational environment for states,
individuals and trade actors.

Finally, uncertainty is the trigger for the precautionary
principle.[^09chapter9_55] Data flows as well as inchoate technology generate
unpredictable events for all the actors of informational environment and
therefore sovereignty, privacy and trade. Hence, there is a genuine
interest to eliminate uncertainty by introducing precautionary measures.
However, the only way to reduce uncertainty is by introducing legal
certainty aligned with social expectations which means adherence to the
regulatory principles.

By all means, the determination of a threshold of legal certainty
regarding IMCs is a nontrivial task. Adopting an approach oriented at
IMCs, it is proposed to subject DL policies to the following criteria
placed in a hierarchical order:[^09chapter9_56]

1.  under no circumstances shall a DL policy generate legal uncertainty;

2.  a DL policy shall prevent legal uncertainty;

3.  a DL policy shall reduce legal uncertainty;

4.  a DL policy shall benefit data flows.

The first criterion is of a critical importance and therefore failure to
adhere to it would result in over-enforcement. In turn, legal
uncertainty exists where a DL policy is inconsistent, disproportionate,
technologically and economically unreasonable. For instance, a DL policy
introducing a broad localization scheme for undefined data categories,
establishing a censorship mechanism at the tremendous cost of private
parties that amounts to *carpet website blockings* and on top of that
which is arbitrary enforced, would not be justified under the proposed
framework in any event. This is due to the fact that it generates legal
uncertainty instead of preventing or reducing it. While such a scheme
could be highly beneficial for protecting information sovereignty, the
generated legal uncertainty would inadequately affect privacy and trade.
On the other hand, a DL policy of a high-accuracy that requires law
enforcement agencies' access to communications metadata, regardless of
the storage location, with a legally provided possibility to copy such
data for security precautions and a blocking scheme, would have higher
chances to be justified under the proposed framework. Accordingly, such
a DL policy arguably reduces legal uncertainty for all the actors while
also benefiting the development of IMCs by eliminating harmful
activities. Ultimately, a DL policy requiring the disclosure of software
code in the event that such software is exploited for governmental
purposes or there is a good reason to believe that a product contains
backdoors, which could be used for concealed data collection or result
in data breach, also has a better chance to be justified. Respectively,
this would be possible because such DL policy would prevent legal
uncertainty caused by software products and benefit IMCs by securing
confidential data before the event.

As previously described and demonstrated in Figure 1 some features of a
DL system might reduce the overall effect of DL, while others worsen its
notorious effect. Taking into account the regulatory principles, the
more definitive and precise a DL measure is, the more adequate the link
between the measure and the policy objective is, the better a
possibility to construct a smarter data regulatory regime. Approaching
data regulation as a complex system should result in a highly
scrutinized regulatory scheme. This might be more effective compared to
binary choices.

## Conclusion 

Data justice or balance within the framework of power relations over
data is obviously necessary in today's world, but it is impossible to
approach without smart data regulation. Far from being a fully designed
concept, it is plausible to infer that smart data regulation regarding
DL should constitute a small-scaled policy based on an adequate number
of regulatory tools (variables) with well-defined subject matter (types)
rather than extensive and broad regulation. This is more likely to
sustain and enrich IMCs, while ensuring the competing interests of all
information agents by means of preserving the balance between legally
certain regulatory interventions and private autonomy.

Each detail in a data regulatory mechanism matters. From the overall
purpose and wording, to technical nature and implementation. By
abstracting elements the regulator risks creating expensive, ineffective
and damaging regulations resulting in unintended consequences. The
regulator has to be sensitive to every action against information flows
and provide safety nets as negligence might result in data injustices
and affect societal welfare.

[^09chapter9_4]: Consider regulatory institutes such as restrictions on technology
    export and state secrets.

[^09chapter9_5]: For instance, Sweden adopted the Swedish Data Bank Statute as
    early as 1973. This was a response to the overseas storage of data
    connected to Swedish citizens. See John M. Eger, 'Emerging
    Restrictions on Transnational Data Flows: Privacy Protection or
    Non-Tariff Trade Barriers', *Law & Policy in International Business*

[^09chapter9_6]: At large DL analysis presents taxonomy and being surrounded by
    countless dichotomies (e.g. data/information, privacy/public
    security, etc.) was trapped within the binary constraints of
    traditional regulatory approaches. Justice of the US Supreme Court
    Anthony M. Kennedy has provided a great example of binary regulatory
    choices during the oral argument in the *United States v. Microsoft
    Corporation*. In the course of extraterritoriality discussion
    Justice Kennedy has raised a question of why should SCOTUS be
    focused on data location storage v. data location disclosure and
    whether SCOTUS is forced to make such a choice. See 'United States

[^09chapter9_37]: As an alternative to DL policies scholars sometimes refer to the
    Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties (MLATs). While under MLATs states
    may agree on information exchange and establish an effective regime
    of cross-border data interception, this mechanism is extremely time
    consuming and of a highly political nature. In most cases the
    request for the information exchange under MLATs may be easily
    denied. Thus, under the MLAT between Russia and the United States
    'the execution of the request [may be denied if it] would
    prejudice the security or other essential interests of the Requested
    Party'. Apparently, the category of essential interests is broad and
    would have different meanings for both Russia and the United States
    especially considering the current state of international relations
    between both actors. Hence, while recognizing the role, although
    somewhat limited, of MLATs in controlling cross-border data flows,
    this chapter leaves the question of their potential to constitute a
    substitute to DL polices open and subject to the future research.

    (e.g. designating a state-owned data center for an obligatory data
    storage). Protected local provider problem -- a deterioration of
    local data processing services as a result of a limited competition
    established by the DL policy (i.e. data processing market shrinks by
    excluding international businesses).

[^09chapter9_48]: Gervais, 'Regulation of Inchoate Technologies', 684-88.

[^09chapter9_49]: Consider the following. Russian measures require storing data
    onshore, but do not prohibit data being transferred abroad in full.
    Australian measures require storing data onshore by prohibiting any
    transfer of PCEHR overseas unless redacted, anonymized and conducted
    by an authorized public agency. Obviously, without taking into
    consideration other features of the systems it is impossible to
    conclude whether any of them amount to smart regulatory practice.
