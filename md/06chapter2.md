# 2: Good Data Practices for Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Governance<br />
*Raymond Lovett, Vanessa Lee, Tahu Kukutai, Donna Cormack, Stephanie
Carroll Rainie and Jennifer Walker*

**Abstract**

Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDS) and Indigenous Data Governance (IDG)
are terms increasingly being used across community, research, policy and
in practice. The IDS movement has emerged in response to poor data
practices, from the conceptualisation of data items through to reporting
of data about Indigenous peoples. This chapter aims to provide clarity
concerning the definitions of IDS and IDG; provide an overview of the
historical context in which IDS has emerged; and provide examples of IDS
and IDG across the spectrum of community, policy and practice.

## Introduction

For Indigenous peoples, historical encounters with statistics have been
fraught, and none more so than when involving official data produced as
part of colonial attempts at statecraft. Governments in the settler
states of Australasia and North America have amassed large amounts of
data on their Indigenous populations to generate statistics as
'evidence' for population monitoring and policy interventions.[^02chapter2_1] Set
against this, Indigenous nations, communities and data activists have
responded with their own agendas for 'good data'; Indigenous Data
Sovereignty (IDS) and Indigenous Data Governance (IDG) movements are
contemporary articulations of 'good data' and are the central focus of
this chapter.

At the heart of IDS and IDG is the right of Indigenous peoples and
nations to decide what data development occurs and the controls over the
collection, governance, ownership, and application of data about their
peoples, territories, lifeways and natural resources.[^02chapter2_2] IDS is
grounded in Indigenous understandings of sovereignty that challenge
dominant 'data sovereignty' discourse and current practice, and is
supported by global human rights instruments such as the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). This chapter
provides perspectives from Indigenous scholars across Australia,
Aotearoa, and North America to explain the genesis and development of
the IDS movement, acknowledging the nascent IDS movements outside these
areas.[^02chapter2_3] We begin with a brief discussion of the historical context of
Indigenous statistics. We then discuss the defining elements of IDS and
IDG, and the development of country-specific IDS processes. We conclude
with three examples of IDS and IDG in practice. The intent of this
chapter is to inform others on how the application of IDS and IDG can
lead to good data and good decision-making.

## Defining Data

The idea of data is a broad concept, but in the context of this chapter,
we define data as information that may be recorded in various forms. In
the contemporary context, this mostly includes digital data. The
Indigenous data ecosystem is extensive and includes data generated or
held by Indigenous communities and organisations, governments, the
public sector, international governmental organisations (IGOs), NGOs,
research institutions and commercial entities. Therefore, the
application of IDS and IDG crosses many boundaries.[^02chapter2_4]

## Defining Indigenous Data Sovereignty

'Data sovereignty' is the management of information in a way that aligns
with the laws, practices and customs of a nation-state in which it is
located.[^02chapter2_5] In the Indigenous context this may manifest at the group
(iwi(tribe)/mob/Māori) levels.

## Defining Indigenous Data Governance

Data governance is the power and authority over the design, ownership,
access to and use of data. The governance of data has emerged as a
highly contested area of debate between Indigenous peoples and the
states within which they reside. For Indigenous peoples, whose
traditional modes of governance were disrupted by western modes of
democratic governance, re-asserting themselves through self-determined
governance structures is critical. Ownership of governance structures
commences at the development stage, and continues through the ethics
application stage and through the collection, analysis and reporting of
data, and through policy translation. Indigenous peoples' ownership is
integral to autonomy.

## Historical context of Data Sovereignty

Indigenous peoples have always been data collectors and protectors. Data
gathering and preservation existed in most, if not all, Indigenous
cultures in the form of art and pictorial calendars (e.g. Lakota winter
counts), chants, songs, the recitation of genealogies and other cultural
practices that have been passed on across generations. With colonisation
these practices were disrupted (and often heavily censured), but not
extinguished. In many contexts, the census was an indispensable tool of
colonisation; indeed, the census has long been tied to the exercise of
power and statecraft. [^02chapter2_6] The word 'census' comes from the Latin word
'censere', which means to tax or assess, and the origins of the census
coincide with the rise of early Chinese, Egyptian and Roman states and
their extraction of resources from the population, either through
taxation, labour or military conscription.[^02chapter2_7] With the expansion of
colonial powers into new lands, the census facilitated the surveillance
and control of Indigenous peoples and their lands, and political
projects of segregation and/or assimilation. In Aotearoa NZ, for
example, the counting of 'half-castes' in 19^th^ and early 20^th^
century censuses was clearly linked to colonial policies of racial
amalgamation.[^02chapter2_8] Across what is currently Canada, representatives of
the British Crown and the Canadian government have undertaken counts and
established lists of Indigenous people since before Canadian
Confederation in 1867. Colonial legislation, in the form of the Indian
Act (1876 to present), has resulted in registration lists of First
Nations and Inuit peoples, termed the 'Indian Register'.[^02chapter2_9]

In Australia, a long-standing committee advised on government held data
pertaining to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) in conjunction with
the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) convened the National Advisory
Group on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Information and
Data (NAGATSIHID). The main role of NAGATSIHID was to provide strategic
advice to the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council (AHMAC) on
Indigenous health data issues as part of a national strategy towards
closing the data gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and
non-Indigenous people.[^02chapter2_10] However, in 2017 this group was disbanded in
a review of committees, and the gap remains. There is now no national
level mechanism to advise on the use of Indigenous health information.
As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander voices in the process
are minimal, at a time of policy change surrounding government
administrative data, including increasing the availability and improving
the use of data in Australia.[^02chapter2_11]

One of the more egregious contemporary examples of the misuse of
Indigenous data is the well-known Havasupai case.[^02chapter2_12] In 2004, concerns
escalated in Arizona and nationwide in the United States related to
biological samples collected from the Havasupai Tribe, with human
subject violations cited.[^02chapter2_13] In the 1990s, an Arizona State University
researcher conducted a genetics of diabetes study with the Havasupai
Tribe, taking DNA samples from over 400 tribal members with consent for
primary use of the biological materials. The study failed to find a
genetic link to diabetes. Later, the researcher directed secondary
analyses of the DNA samples with respect to schizophrenia. When this
secondary use of specimens came to light, the tribe filed a lawsuit
alleging lack of informed consent and misuse of genetic materials. The
lawsuit settled out of court, but lasting damage to research
relationships as well as a ban on genetics research at Havasupai and
other tribes remain.

Contemporary IDS was pioneered by the work of Canadian First Nations
communities. In 1995, tired of non-Indigenous data users assuming the
mantle of unbiased experts and speaking with authority about First
Nations realities, data sovereignty was demanded as a prerequisite for a
government health survey in First Nations communities. A new model was
developed by First Nations that established First Nations' collective
and broad-based control of their own data. This model became known as
OCAP® with the acronym trademarked to prevent its use except by First
Nations[^02chapter2_14]. In this acronym the O is Ownership; C is the Control First
Nations hold on how the data are collected, used and disclosed; A is
Access, whereby First Nations have access to any data about them; and P
is Possession whereby all First Nations data fall within First Nations'
jurisdiction. Since the establishment of OCAP® principles by First
Nations, similar and adapted sets of principles have emerged in other
Indigenous groups within Canada. For example, the recent National Inuit
Strategy on Research establishes Inuit ownership, control and access
with respect to Inuit data and information. To some degree, these
principles are now acknowledged by federal departments and agencies,
such as Statistics Canada. These principles are primarily used in the
area of data collection, but not in the analysis of existing data
collected through the census or other government surveys.

## Emergence of IDS movements

Indigenous groups across the world have increasingly become engaged in
the data space in response to historical practice and to guide good
practice going forward. This has included the establishment of country
specific networks including the US Indigenous Data Sovereignty Network
(USIDSN) to support IDS through data-driven research, policy advocacy,
and education. The Aotearoa New Zealand-based Te Mana Raraunga - Māori
Data Sovereignty Network, was formed in 2015,[^02chapter2_15] and argues that data
that are collected about Indigenous people should be subjected to the
laws of the nation from which it is collected, including tribal nations.
The First Nations Information Governance Centre advocates for and
coordinates Indigenous data governance efforts for First Nations in
Canada; the Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Data Sovereignty Collective in Australia was formed in early 2017[^02chapter2_16]
to develop Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data sovereignty
principles and to identify Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
strategic data assets. The intent of these groups is to advocate for
rights (informed by UNDRIP) using data to inform development.

## United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)

UNDRIP was the result of a quarter of a century work to develop minimum
standards to protect Indigenous peoples' rights. After a series of
changes to the draft (initially submitted in 1994), the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) was adopted by
the General Assembly on 13 September 2007.[^02chapter2_17]A majority of 144 states
voted in favour, four voted against (notably Australia, New Zealand,
Canada and the United States), and 11 abstained.[^02chapter2_18] Australia did not
adopt the declaration until 2009, even though it played a key role in
the development of the United Nations' Declaration of Human Rights.[^02chapter2_19]
Aotearoa and the United States adopted the Declaration the following
year in 2010.[^02chapter2_20] Canada issued a Statement of Support in November
2010, but the Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs did not
announce Canada's full commitment until May 2016.[^02chapter2_21]

Article 18 of the UNDRIP specifies that 'Indigenous peoples have the
right to participate in decision-making in matters which affect their
rights, through representatives chosen by themselves in accordance with
their own procedures, as well as to maintain and develop their own
Indigenous decision-making institutions'.[^02chapter2_22] Article 19 stipulates
that states are required to 'consult and cooperate in good faith with
Indigenous peoples through their own representative institutions in
order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting
and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect
them'.[^02chapter2_23] As Tauli-Corpuz suggests,[^02chapter2_24] measures are needed to gauge
Indigenous peoples access and ownership of land, how they participate in
decision-making and control on their development and application
processes, and control over the data and knowledge. In the same
foundational publication, Kukutai and Taylor highlight that to give
'practical effect' to UNDRIP, Indigenous peoples should assert (and are
asserting) control of data from nation states^.^[^02chapter2_25] Both UNDRIP
articles require data to appropriately inform legislative and
administrative decisions.

Based on the groundwork from First Nations in Canada and with additional
impetus provided through UNDRIP, Indigenous groups have, over time,
developed principles specific to their IDS context.

## Indigenous Data Sovereignty and Governance in practice

Here we present examples of IDS and IDG in practice. The first example
from Australia concerns both IDS and IDG.

### Australia 

The Mayi Kuwayu: The National Study of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Wellbeing (meaning 'to follow Aboriginal people' in Ngiyampaa
language) is a national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
longitudinal study. The aim of the study is to develop national-level
cultural indicators and examine how culture interacts with health and
wellbeing. It is publicly funded research and is housed at the
Australian National University (ANU) in Australia.[^02chapter2_28] The study
development processes are designed to adhere to IDS and IDG. The data
development considerations in the Mayi Kuwayu Study include:

-   Development of new data items that represent cultural expression and
    practice (data of importance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait
    Islander peoples);

-   The Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (the
    Code), that requires research data ownership and storage to be
    described;

-   Research ethics[^02chapter2_29] and intellectual property,[^02chapter2_30] to acknowledge
    the sources of information and those who have contributed to the
    research. If Indigenous knowledge contributes to intellectual
    property, recognising the contribution, where appropriate, by
    transferring or sharing intellectual property and any benefits that
    result from the research'.[^02chapter2_31]

-   An Indigenous Data Governance group that develops data access and
    release protocols based on IDS principles.

The Mayi Kuwayu Study has developed a number of mechanisms to address
many of the existing data processes identified above. This includes
ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leadership and management
of the study from the outset, through leadership of the study by
majority Aboriginal Chief Investigators and research staff. Further, in
the development of cultural data items, the research team undertook 24
focus groups with a diverse range of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
islander groups across Australia, embedding their feedback into
priorities for measurement while also seeking suggestions on cultural
appropriateness of questions and methods.

In the MK Study, ongoing data collection and ownership of the data set
is shared between the research institute and participants under
institutional policy (and its use is currently governed by the Study's
Governance group that includes investigators and representatives from
Aboriginal institutional project partners and community). Further, the
research team and study governance group are developing protocols for
data storage, access, analysis, and dissemination.

### Aotearoa (New Zealand)

Aotearoa NZ is one of the world's most advanced digital nations.[^02chapter2_32]
Data is seen as a key national strategic asset,[^02chapter2_33] and several key
policy and legislative initiatives are underway to facilitate easier
data sharing and linkage. A flagship project is the Integrated Data
Infrastructure (IDI), a world-leading research database under the
stewardship of Statistics New Zealand that contains de-identified data
(including Māori data) from more than 50 surveys and administrative
datasets across the state, research and NGO sectors. With a greater
focus on data-driven policy-making has come an increased interest in how
'social license'[^02chapter2_34] can enable more flexible data sharing without
explicit individual consent. Missing from these innovations, however,
are robust models of data governance and ethics, value creation and
benefit-sharing to enhance 'good data' and 'good outcomes'.

Māori have often been at the sharp end of intrusive data surveillance
and misuse but have well-tested 'tikanga' (ethics, processes,
principles) around the protection and sharing of knowledge for
collective benefit that can be readily adapted to digital data
environments. Māori Data Sovereignty (MDS) advocates are developing a
number of tikanga-based solutions including: models of Māori/iwi
(tribal) data governance for the IDI and wider government ecosystem;
'cultural license' as the 'social license' alternative for community
acceptability of data use; and a Māori Data Audit Tool to assess
organisational readiness to incorporate MDS principles. Many of the
assumptions underpinning old and emerging data ecosystems rest on
Anglo-European legal concepts, such as individual privacy and ownership,
which translate poorly into the big and open data environments. What is
needed is a radically different way of conceptualising rights that
relate to massive quantities of data and the value that can be extracted
from. The direct beneficiaries of the 'data revolution' have largely
been data producers and controllers, not the individuals and collectives
from which data are drawn. IDS and MDS demands clear lines of
accountability and benefit sharing; at the heart of these demands is a
call for power sharing. Seen this way, the potential benefits of
embedding MDS principles across government data ecosystems extend beyond
Māori to include the wider public.

As a result of the rapidity of changes in data capabilities and
technology, there can be a tension between responding to technological
imperatives and to changes being driven by other actors (e.g. Government
and corporations) and focusing on Māori aspirations and priorities. The
MDS space is also a creative space where there is potential for Māori to
(re-)imagine relationships and practices that realise Māori aspirations
for data sovereignty, including those that may operate outside currently
existing structures.

### North America

One of the landmark results of the establishment of OCAP® principles in
Canada has been the multiphase First Nations Regional Health Survey,
which is designed, implemented and analyzed by First Nations
organizations in Canada.[^02chapter2_35] A coordinating national organization, the
First Nations Information Governance Centre was established to lead the
efforts to expand this First Nations-driven survey approach to
education, labour and employment and other key areas.

Across Canada, each of the three distinct Indigenous Peoples in Canada
(First Nations, Métis and Inuit) have also asserted sovereignty over the
data that are held about their encounters with the provincial health
system.[^02chapter2_36] This has resulted in a mosaic of relationships, Data
Sharing Agreements, and Data Governance Agreements in each Canadian
province to ensure that decisions about the use and sharing of First
Nations, Inuit, and Métis data are made by the respective governance
organizations.

## Conclusions

While the IDS movement has emerged in response to poor data practices
and exclusion, IDS and IDG provide opportunities to reconfigure current
approaches to data, including embedding good governance of Indigenous
data that supports self-determination and wellbeing for Indigenous
communities. Good data, including good data governance, are necessary to
ensure Indigenous peoples benefit from current and future data practices
and to mitigate the potential for continued harm. IDS movements also
support broader transformative aims of developing Indigenous-owned and
controlled data infrastructures, protocols and community capabilities
that lie beyond the reach of nation states and corporations.
