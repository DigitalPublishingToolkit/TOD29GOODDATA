Abstract:   In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the collection, aggregation and automated analysis of information by government and private actors, and in response to this there has been a significant critique regarding what could be termed ‘bad’ data practices in the globalised digital economy. 
In order to paint an alternative, more optimistic but still pragmatic picture of the datafied future, this book examines and proposes ‘good data’ practices, values and principles from an interdisciplinary, international perspective. From ideas of data sovereignty and justice, to manifestos for change and calls for activism, this collection opens a multifaceted conversation on the kinds of futures we want to see, and presents concrete steps on how we can start realising good data in practice.

# 18: Truly Smart Cities. Buen Conocer, Digital Activism and Urban Agroecology in Colombia
*Juan-Carlos Valencia and Paula Restrepo*

**Abstract**

This chapter comes out of two research projects carried out in Colombia,
South America. One of them, finished in 2017, was called *City of Data*.
It was an exploration of government-led, centralized Smart City projects
being implemented in the cities of Bogotá and Medellín. The other one,
still ongoing, is called *Communication Practices in the Medellín's
Gardeners Network: Knowledge, Territory and Social Fabric.* It is an
exploration of knowledge construction, and virtual and real
territorialization through grass-roots gardening initiatives in Cali and
Medellín. Both research projects had to do with approaches to public
data: some 'centralized', government-led in the form of Smart City
projects and others, more in the form of citizen-led initiatives. We
analysed project documents, conducted semi-structured interviews with
dozens of officials and citizen group leaders, and carried out
participatory research with a citizen collective in the city of
Medellín. Our main goal was to analyze government-led and
grass-roots-led initiatives producing and managing data to empower
citizens in Medellín and Bogotá. Our theoretical perspective comes from
Critical Data Studies, Surveillance Studies, Decoloniality and
Relational Ontologies. We found very closed and centralized data
production practices in the government-led, smart city initiatives
studied, but discovered what could be described as promising 'good data'
citizen-led approaches in Medellín's Gardeners Network (RHM). We also
found some issues and challenges arising from the particular,
non-western, highly unequal context of these citizen-led initiatives.

## A Brief Review of Smart City Literature

Smart City projects are being implemented around the world, from
Amsterdam to New Delhi, from Los Angeles to Rio de Janeiro. The
definition of what a Smart City is differs from place to place, from
project to project and between theoretical perspectives. The concept has
evolved from a sector-based, corporate or government focused approach to
a more comprehensive view that pays more attention to governance and
stakeholders' involvement at the core of strategies.[^18chapter18_1] According to
some proponents and to optimistic academic perspectives, Smart City
projects promise to improve the quality of life of urban populations
and, at the same time, to make better use of both tangible and
intangible resources and public infrastructures.[^18chapter18_2] Networked
infrastructures would improve economic and political efficiency and
enable social, cultural and urban development,[^18chapter18_3] but this would only
happen when Smart City projects take all the stakeholders' opinions into
account and seek a compromise between their views and the implementation
of the strategies. This literature still believes in Smart City
approaches that are government-facilitated but purposefully
citizen-centric or even citizen-led. There is a growing emphasis on
collaborative economies and innovation.[^18chapter18_4] It remains to be seen
whether these later approaches fulfil their goals thoroughly and if
there are socially successful, really democratic and participative Smart
City projects being implemented around the world.

But from the perspective of Critical Data Studies and Surveillance
Studies scholars, to whom we feel closer, these projects are based on an
illusion of technocratic efficiency and a highly suspicious discourse of
digital democratization that hides the economic interests of technology
corporations and the designs of neoliberal governments around the world.
Daniel McQuillan explains that the Smart City 'is inscribed by an
endless stream of heterogeneous data points that pour from our networked
daily experiences'.[^18chapter18_5] It marks a shift in government intervention in
social space from discrete forms of 'intermittent and/or specific
information-gathering to continuous processes of management based on
total and unremitting surveillance'.[^18chapter18_6]

Data is produced by citizens even when they are not specifically
creating content: their use of public transport cards and public
hot-spots, the traffic they generate while driving, the amount of taxes
they pay, their consumption of power, water and other utilities, the
crimes they report to the police, their location coordinates;[^18chapter18_7] all
these activities are being translated into data flows that are
correlated with other sources of information to manufacture metadata
that could be understood as data commons and should be available to
all,[^18chapter18_8] but that in fact are the domain of government agencies and
corporations.

## Top-down Smart City Projects in the Global South

In the Global South, Smart City projects are promoted by resorting to
the decades-old myth of Development:[^18chapter18_9] traditional societies must
embrace new technology and science to finally modernize and join the
ranks of developed nations. This myth, denounced by Decolonial scholars
and activists such as Esteva and Escobar, dictates that it is necessary:

> \[...\] to take knowledge to an uneducated society under the
> assumption that the life of citizens is impoverished by the lack of
> scientific and technological know-how. It is also based on the idea
> that science and technology are naturally beneficial and are not
> related to political and economic interests.[^18chapter18_10]

But both in the Global North and the South, data collection enables what
McQuillan describes as a colonial mapping that extends to our feelings,
our physiology and even our faces. For analysts like Kitchin and
Lauriault,[^18chapter18_11] the data captured, processed and constructed by
technologies are never neutral; they are immersed in ideologies and
worldviews, and get their meaning in concrete socio-historic contexts,
where data serves particular goals. What is considered relevant and
significant, and constructed as useful data, ignores the perspectives,
goals and concerns of different social actors.

Critical analysts are also concerned about the biopolitical implications
of Smart City projects: the increased surveillance, the privatization
and exploitation of the commons, the neoliberal necropolitics that
data-supported governance could allow, the consolidation of what Lash
has called 'Algorithmic power'.[^18chapter18_12] Smart City projects serve 'the
purposes of power, and as the sensors of the smart city see more deeply
in to our lives, they colonize the new spaces that they find'.[^18chapter18_13] We
agree with Colding and Barthel when they propose that Smart City
literature and research should include analysis around social
sustainability issues for city dwellers, reflect more about whom the
Smart City is for, address issues of cultural diversity, resilience and
cyber security, and think about the impact of Smart City projects on
human-nature relations.[^18chapter18_14]

The implementation of Smart City projects differs greatly from place to
place, their scopes are diverse, and the uses given to the data and
metadata collected are not monolithic and sometimes not even coherent or
thorough.[^18chapter18_15] This happens both in the Global North where projects and
applications fail, are based on racial prejudices,[^18chapter18_16] and targeted by
special interests, as in the Global South,[^18chapter18_17] so diverse and
culturally rich, but so uneven, chaotic and plagued by corruption.

Our research of Smart City projects in Bogotá and Medellín analyzed the
work of city government agencies and hybrid private and public
institutions like Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Bogotá, the National
Police, *Medellin Ciudad Inteligente* and *Ruta N.*[^18chapter18_18] It was
difficult for us to establish a relationship of trust with governmental
or public-private institutions. For example, the Medellín Metro never
agreed to give us information, *Ruta N* stopped responding our requests
for additional interviews when we refused to organize a meeting of
grassroots organizations to have a *Ruta N*-lead conversation about data
and collaborative work, and *Medellín Ciudad Inteligente* was dismantled
and reorganized soon after our first and only visit. With Medellín's
Gardeners Network we established a relationship that allowed us to get
closer to what they were doing, and to also understand the complexity
and some of the internal conflicts in the organization. For these
reasons, this chapter takes a panoramic look at government and
public-private led Smart City projects, but delves much more into a
citizen-led initiative, the RHM case.

In the case of government-led Smart City projects our interviews with
officials, members of citizen collectives and individuals allowed us to
discover a complex situation: conflicts and rivalry between government
agencies and institutions result in the misuse of data or in its
transformation into abstract figures and charts, confusedly mentioned to
legitimize policies and political propaganda. New administrations
discard previous and ongoing efforts, dismantle research and policy
units and force projects to start from scratch. Sophisticated data that
contradicts special interests is ignored or discarded. The capacity to
collect and process vast amounts of data overwhelms the capacity of
existing political institutions and agents to analyze it and use it.
Smart City projects may buy and use complex sensor systems and software
but people, working in stressful and contradictory conditions, run them.
The Smart City projects that we selected and studied in Colombia seem to
be developed in a vertical, fragmented and discontinuous way. They are
not citizen-led at all and it is dubious that they could be described as
purposefully citizen-centric. At least in the case of a Latin American
city like Medellín, the projects are full of contradictions, lack
transparency and in some cases become pockets of corruption that benefit
corporations and an industry of mercenary international advisers. This
does not mean that big data are not used by some government agencies to
try to control populations for questionable purposes. We just want to
point out that the control grid is not completely sealed.

The government and public-private-led Smart City projects that we
selected as case studies largely considered citizens as disempowered,
uneducated, disorganized individuals whose capacities and knowledge
could be fostered and canalized by the institutions. Some officials
considered citizens as a potential threat in case they were given access
to public data. They insisted that data could be released to the public
only when solid organizations and initiatives emerge, but not before. We
understood that they feared that adopting open data policies or even
just releasing limited sets of data would give ammunition to their
political foes and make government initiatives, agencies and policies
vulnerable to partisan, intolerable scrutiny. This was the case, for
example, of the Medellín Metro system. It is a public company. We and
other researchers and citizen collectives have been requesting access to
simple data such as station congestion, peak traffic hours and power
consumption with no significant response.

*Ruta N Corporation* considered that citizens could be convened to help
co-create solutions to urgent urban problems. Their officials distrust
top-down smart city projects that did not connect somehow to the local
population and did not take into account their cultural context. They
celebrated the fact that at the time of our field work, more than 15,000
citizens of Medellín had become involved in co-creating solutions to
city problems, together with *Ruta N,* interacting with officials
through social networks and in special events. But nevertheless, it was
the agency that played the role of identifying the key problems,
recruited citizens to create solutions and recognized them as such.

Another agency called *Medellin Ciudad Inteligente* (Medellín Smart
City) has gone through different reorganizations, depending on the local
government in turn. When we contacted them in 2015, the agency had
become a sort of local news outlet: a group of more than sixty web
designers and journalists collecting and publishing information about
Medellín and its citizens. They were training people in the city's
neighborhoods in basic internet tools, digital photography and writing,
to get them to produce local content. A year later, this goal was
abandoned and most staff were sacked. Currently, this is the name of the
public internet network of the city, but it is not possible to find an
agency with such a name.

## Social Movements, *Buen Conocer*, Good Data and Postcolonial Computing 

But are citizens so unknowledgeable about data technologies? Are they
unaware of its potentials? Do they lack the organization and ideas to
develop alternative, more democratic uses of data? Aren't they producing
any form of *Good Data*?

Most critical approaches to Smart City projects leave little room for
agency on the part of citizens. This is why we agree with Couldry and
Powell when they argue that 'emerging cultures of data collection
deserve to be examined in a way that foregrounds the agency and
reflexivity of individual actors as well as the variable ways in which
power and participation are constructed and enacted'.[^18chapter18_19] As mentioned,
our research also focused on citizen strategies for building alternative
economies of information. We tried to underscore human agency in
relation to data and technology.[^18chapter18_20] We did find pockets of resistance
to datafication but more interestingly, we came across some urban
collectives fighting for the release of public, high quality, socially
relevant data. These citizen organizations create communities of
resistance and action that demand open data and transparency from public
administrators. They also strive to achieve different forms of
technological appropriation, the creation of citizen technologies, the
production of *Good Data* and the constitution of networks that
materialize new forms of communality and become spaces of collective
intellect. They demand that government proposals be 'based more on
bottom-up approaches in which cities provide access to data and allow
citizens to make their own decisions'.[^18chapter18_21]

Their efforts are creating more diverse Smart City projects from the
bottom up and could be understood as what some theorists in Latin
America are describing as *Buen Conocer*, 'an interesting process of
creative collaboration, 'significant collective intelligence' that mixes
knowledges, avant-garde challenges and contextualized solutions to
everyday realities'.[^18chapter18_22] Some Global South digital activists are
engaging in what academics have called Postcolonial Computing:[^18chapter18_23] a
way of creating software that is critically aware of its context of
production and its power relations, not as something to ignore or solve
technocratically but as a reality that must be taken into account. They
propose a shift from expert designed software and privatized,
capital-enhancing data that fundamentally follow the prescriptions of
corporations and the Eurocentric worldviews of IT specialists[^18chapter18_24] to
community designed software and open data that benefits all, humans and
non-humans. Truly Smart Cities would operate from the bottom up, taking
into consideration the well-being of all, humans and non-humans. They
work based on the Marxist idea that general social
knowledge has become a direct force of
production. Truly
Smart Cities could only emerge from citizen-led, communitarian efforts,
an expression of the general intellect arising from social practice, of
the real life process.

## Red de Huerteros Medellín

We will focus now on the work of an independent network of urban
agriculture, the Medellín's Gardeners Network (Red de Huerteros Medellín
or RHM for its initials in Spanish). First we will offer a brief
description of Medellín, the context where this citizen-led initiative
operates.

Medellín is the second largest city in Colombia. It has been an
important industrial hub since the early 20^th^ Century. Textile,
chemical and plastics factories were established in the area. The
population rose from 358,189 inhabitants in 1951 to more than 2.5
million in 2017, a sevenfold increase. The industrial sector has taken a
hit due to competition from Asia, but factories still operate in the
city, many of them with poor waste and pollutant management practices.
Cars and motorcycles overflow the streets and this, together with large
migration from the countryside and a construction boom, has resulted in
a serious environmental crisis. Air pollution has triggered alarms
frequently since 2017. Furthermore, Medellín, like so many cities around
the world, has been experiencing an increased symbolic and material
privatization of space. The dangerous levels of air pollution, the
persistent violence and real estate speculation generate visible and
invisible borders and deepening socioeconomic gaps. But the city has
also become a pocket of environmental resistance, where various citizen
collectives are pushing for alternative ways to manage urban space,
denounce and monitor air pollution and criticize the felling of trees.

The RHM is a citizen collective that emerged around 2013 at the
initiative of residents of central-western Medellín. They started
orchards in their terraces and front yards, and later in abandoned
buildings, sidewalks and parks. The members of the RHM come from
different backgrounds, professions, genders and economic conditions, but
share the goal of making Medellín greener. With the passing of time, the
network grew and spread. Interest in different forms of urban
agriculture, strategies to manage organic waste, concern with the
quality of food, the survival of bees and other insects, the defense of
traditional, non-genetically-modified seeds, the control of air
pollution and urban soil contamination by heavy metals and the
strengthening of communities became topics of discussion and action.
Some members consider that despite the examples of Cuba[^18chapter18_25] and
Argentina,[^18chapter18_26] urban agriculture cannot fully supply the demand of such
a big and polluted city as Medellín. But they want to do something, they
want to learn, meet and take action.

The Network has been growing gradually, adding various parts of the city
and connecting with people around the world. It has turned its original
urban planting and gardening activities into spaces of social
articulation, construction of commonality and knowledge dialogues.[^18chapter18_27]
They use different communication means to organize their activities, to
foster social links in a city with so many scars dating from the years
of drug cartel wars and the many conflicts of Colombia. The Network
organizers do not know exactly how many people compose it, but current
membership in the RHM Facebook group tops 6800 people. Like any network,
the RHM is composed of nodes and relationships between them. Some of
these nodes work to keep the network well connected, while others are
dedicated to maintaining their individual and group projects. In this
way, the RHM is not a homogeneous structure. However, there is a node
that calls itself the base group, and that has more or less homogeneous
intentions, articulated in a Manifesto called 'Sowing Sovereign and
Solidarity Worlds'.[^18chapter18_28] Some of the nodes are aware and subscribe to
the ideas of the Manifesto, others do not know it, do not understand
many of its ideas or do not fully subscribe to them. When we refer to
the network of 'huerteros', we refer then to the base group and the
activities that it develops in articulation with other nodes and
grassroots organizations.

## Territory, Data and Relational Ontologies

One of the sections of the Manifesto refers to open data and free
knowledge, and states: 'We promote the use of open data, software and
free knowledge without barriers as a way to transform culture, to grow
as a society and to rescue the community values of collective sharing
and doing'. This section is articulated with others related to the Earth
as a living organism, food autonomy, food as a political act,
agroecology as practice and as social movement, free seeds, food
diversity, territorial connection through the activity in the gardens,
creativity, community learning, collaborative work for the common good,
rural-urban solidarity, conscious consumption practices, re-use of
organic waste and bicycles as a form of transport.

The members of the Network reject the understanding of territory as just
a commodity. Urban planning views the city as a place for the
realization of Capital through real estate projects and other actions
aimed at stimulating economic growth and development, regardless of
their consequences. The RHM is involved in an ontological struggle that
takes place in the urban space.

Proponents of an ontological turn in the Social Sciences have been
largely focused on exploring alterity in Indigenous and to a lesser
extent Afro-descendant communities, but following Marisol de la
Cadena,[^18chapter18_29] we consider that we can analyze the dynamics of some
non-Indigenous and non-Afro-descendant urban actors as ontologies. De la
Cadena puts on the table the dispute between those who seek to preserve
'the networks of emplacement that enable local life' in their dynamics
of action (or enaction as Escobar, following Varela, explains),[^18chapter18_30] and
those who destroy them while converting territory into immaterial assets
that support financial speculation[^18chapter18_31].

For the RHM the urban territory is a *network of emplacement*.[^18chapter18_32] The
Network views the city as a melting pot where it should be possible to
rearticulate the social fabric and where human and non-human actors
could coexist. Furthermore, the city cannot be understood in isolation
from the surrounding countryside that supports it. For these reasons,
the RHM is constantly developing initiatives that connect people,
non-humans and spaces with the goal of protecting the environment and
the life that inhabits it.

Resistance to economic and political power arises from micro-territories
inhabited by active, empowered communities. While knitting a
micro-territorial network,[^18chapter18_33],the RHM is trying to redistribute power
and to replace a hegemonic mercantilist vision with a different set of
relations between the environment, urban nature and people. The
activities that allow these micro-territories to intersect and overlap
also occur in virtual spaces; but virtual interventions in social or
personal spaces are necessarily guided by the real contacts occurring in
material, defended territories. These contacts catalyze the virtual
interactions.[^18chapter18_34]

The RHM has been slowly redefining space through a combination of
various activities: bike tours of the network's gardens, communitarian
activations of gardens, workshops and organic waste management. But to
direct and support their *guerrilla gardening*,[^18chapter18_35] territorial
appropriation and social fabric enhancing activities, the RHM has been
increasingly collecting, producing and using what could be called *Good
Data*. The Network considers citizen-produced, not for profit data as a
key element in the dispute over the urban territory of Medellín. Data
such as the location coordinates of gardens, their dimensions and crops,
the people taking care of them, their waste management initiatives, the
productivity and the local suppliers of agroecological products that
reinforce the ideas of the RHM are being stored in open source, free
software systems. A few members of the Network with computer programming
knowledge manage these applications. They are currently using tools such
as OpenStreetMap,[^18chapter18_36], Mapillary, OsmAnd and OSM Tracker. They designed
a platform called Tupale, totally open and free, that has become the
computer base for the work of the Network.

The RHM resists data manipulations that create a world in which humans
are opposite or outside nature and are in permanent search for its
domination. In this sense we can speak of an articulation between
territorial networks, data and worlds (ontologies) defended,
appropriated and lived.

Besides its commitment to food sovereignty, the redesign of cities,
agroecological food production and reduction of the carbon footprint,
the RHM is also turning orchards into multifunctional spaces of social
articulation, construction of communality and knowledge dialogues.[^18chapter18_37]
Some members of the Network create applications designed with free
software to store information about their activities, agroecological
techniques and databases of the gardens that they are establishing in
public and private spaces, through social mapping tools such as
OpenStreetMap.[^18chapter18_38]

The Network members have grown increasingly conscious of corporate and
government data mining and undemocratic, technocratic Smart City
initiatives and have switched most of their communications to highly
encrypted platforms like Telegram. Yet, the RHM is very active in
Facebook as this platform is widely used in Colombia and it allows new
nodes, gardens and people to connect with the Network. Google
applications are also used but the long-term goal is to have all the
Network activities based on open source, free platforms, not only to
store information but to create *Good* metadata and visualizations to
communicate the RHM activities and objectives.

However, sometimes, the open data and the other ideas of the RHM's
Manifesto collide or result in contradictions. Since there are few
members of the RHM who possess the knowledge to follow the rules of free
software and open data, the registration of activities by other means
such as forms or Google email account end up being the most expeditious
and effective way to advance the work. The difficulty of using messaging
programs that are more respectful of open data such as Telegram, has
ended up causing the communications of the base group to be re-channeled
via WhatsApp at the suggestion of the majority. This generates frictions
between different members of the group. We identified three factions
that are frequently disputing: those closest to the discourse and the
technical knowledge of open data constantly try to convince the others
of the dangers of proprietary and of the benefits of migrating to
computer tools that respect privacy; the less informed often do not
understand the discussion and do not participate in it; a third faction
which is quite informed about the principles of open data but
pragmatically wishes the work to continue and thinks that sometimes open
data principles have to be sacrificed to obtain results.

Although the goal is the free circulation of knowledge and a strong
articulation of do-it-yourself, maker cultures, the reality is complex.
The defense of open data, the fear of corporate and government data
mining and the design of free and open platforms all demand specialized
knowledge. The hacker and maker culture ethics assume that a large
number of people are autonomous and knowledgeable, that they never use
and do not trust private platforms despite the fact that they are tried
and tested and very user-friendly. However, the level of expertise
required to produce, update and maintain free software applications and
visualization tools is high. Data activists in the Global South develop
apps in contexts of extreme inequality and job insecurity. They are
volunteers working in their scarce spare time, and their activism
collides with the normal work they do, the one that allows them to make
a living. Sharing their knowledge with other activists and training more
of them is very difficult. These conditions close the door to greater
participation of other volunteers and the public. Therefore, technology
remains a domain of experts and maintains an air of complexity and
inaccessibility. This is why the creation of apps and the production of
*Good Data* at the RHM are still in the hands of few people.

The Network is currently exploring the development of sensors and
applications that could be categorized as forms of participatory
sensing,[^18chapter18_39] citizen data collected by citizens and used by them in a
decentralized way for democratic purposes. They are counterpoising
commonality to markets and self-governance to distributed
assimilation.[^18chapter18_40] Besides promoting food self-reliance and commonality
in urban spaces, the Network is contributing to the creation of data
countercultures that challenge the mainstream readings of reality
produced by Smart City projects.

## Final Thoughts

The *Good Data* produced by the RHM is transforming the vision of the
city for its members. Paraphrasing Milan and van der Velden,[^18chapter18_41] data
activism supports the new visibility of alternative epistemic cultures
and ontologies present in Latin America, making sense of data as a way
of knowing the world and turning it into a point of intervention, from
the bottom up. The cartographies being created, shared and commented
contribute to *enact* a world that clearly differs from that lived by
entities such as *Medellín Ciudad Inteligente* or *Ruta N*. In this
other world, humans are not outside nature, they are not striving to
dominate it. This is why we speak of an articulation between territorial
networks, data and worlds (ontologies) defended, appropriated and lived:
of truly Smart Cities.

This discussion and our enthusiasm for the results of our research do
not mean that we are not finding contradictions and challenges. Not
every member of RHM is aware of the risks of datafication, of the
privatization of seeds by corporations, the colonization of space by
real estate developers and the monopolization of knowledge by
governments. In this kind of urban social movements, there are different
discourses in different layers and nodes. The Network's purpose and
actions are understood differently by its members.

We also conclude that hacker philosophy and ethics must be read with a
healthy dose of skepticism in order to develop more realistic approaches
to citizen technologies that produce and use *Good Data*. Social
movements attempting to follow maker culture ethic manifestos to the
letter could find themselves in dead ends or find that their efforts at
incorporating technology to their efforts become paralyzed.

Our ongoing participatory research with the RHM aims to help the Network
collect *Good Data* from gardens and gardeners in Medellin, make most of
it available to everyone in the Tupale platform and allow the Network to
make strategic decisions to achieve its goals and turn Medellín into
what the RHM's manifesto has described as a *gardening territory*. We
planned this research together with members of the RHM for more than two
years. We are trying to meet the requests and concerns of the Network
organizers and we have become organizers and gardeners ourselves as
well. We as researchers and the Network are trying to understand how
communication flows among the members. We have come to realize that
communication occupies a central place in the dynamics of social
movements. At the same time, we are trying to understand what
information and knowledge is required in the long term by the RHM, in
order to construct a research program that allows organizers to make
decisions, plans and to respond the permanent demands of academics,
journalists and filmmakers, curious about the Network.
