Abstract:   In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the collection, aggregation and automated analysis of information by government and private actors, and in response to this there has been a significant critique regarding what could be termed ‘bad’ data practices in the globalised digital economy. 
In order to paint an alternative, more optimistic but still pragmatic picture of the datafied future, this book examines and proposes ‘good data’ practices, values and principles from an interdisciplinary, international perspective. From ideas of data sovereignty and justice, to manifestos for change and calls for activism, this collection opens a multifaceted conversation on the kinds of futures we want to see, and presents concrete steps on how we can start realising good data in practice.

# 11: Data Journalism and the Ethics of Open Source

######Colin Porlezza

## Introduction

Data journalism has enjoyed an increasing amount of attention and
success both in media practice and in journalism research. Unlike
traditional journalism, which only recently adopted concepts such as
openness and accountability, data journalism seems to be deeply rooted
in a culture of open source that comes with increased transparency,
shareability and participation. This chapter analyzes the question
whether and to what extent data journalists effectively reflect the
ethical notions of the open source culture in their everyday work
routines and what kind of best practices are in place in order to
minimize the ethical challenges they are confronted with while
accessing, analyzing and publishing data. The proposed chapter offers
therefore a structured insight into whether and how data journalists
implement the four normative principles - transparency, participation,
tinkering, and iteration - that the concept of open source implies. The
chapter also highlights and discusses key ethical standards such as
sharing source-codes or granting third parties with complete access to
raw datasets.


According to Mayer-Schönberger and Cukier,[^11chapter11_1] the growing use of data
provokes 'a revolution that will transform how we live, work and think'.
The datafication of society - the attempt to transform everything into a
specific data format in order to be quantified[^11chapter11_2] - is a fundamental
process because it supersedes both in scope and style the ways in which
reality is seen and constructed. This new data abundance is not only
reflected in the reliance on data as a secular belief,[^11chapter11_3] but also in
the increasingly dominant position of algorithms as cultural artifacts
that announce a new social order.[^11chapter11_4]

Datafication is therefore an all-encompassing transformation that
permeates society as a whole. Journalism is no exception to this trend.
In addition, the journalistic field is a particularly interesting object
of study to observe datafication processes within society: first,
because journalism observes datafication in society and brings the
related issues into the public sphere. Second, because journalism
increasingly embraces data-driven instruments connected to these
processes - data and algorithms - to observe and shed light on the
datafication in the wider society. These changes in journalism practice
lead to new forms of data journalism that offer new opportunities such
as combing through data from public administrations,[^11chapter11_5] or uncovering
wrongdoings.[^11chapter11_6] Data journalism has therefore enjoyed an increasing
amount of attention and success in media practice.

The instruments used to observe datafication processes are often
developed and brought into the news media by actors from outside the
journalistic field such as programmers, computer scientists or hackers.
These actors have not been socialized in newsrooms and have different
cultural references that increasingly shape contemporary journalism,
entailing not only new roles such as hacker journalists,[^11chapter11_7] but also
changes in the current journalistic epistemology: unlike traditional
journalism, data journalism is rooted in a culture of open source that
comes with increased transparency, shareability and participation.

This chapter analyzes therefore the question to what extent data
journalists reflect the ethical notions of the open source culture in
their everyday work routines. By applying Lewis and Usher's four
normative values ​​that are necessary to implement the principles of
open source in the journalistic field - transparency, participation,
tinkering, and iteration - the chapter studies whether Swiss and
Italian data journalists are adhering to the notion of open source and,
in addition, what kind of ethical quandaries they are facing.[^11chapter11_8]

## Data Journalism and Open Source 

The growing academic literature has prompted many definitions of data
journalism. Nevertheless, I understand data journalism, following
Coddington's definition, as a 'hybrid form \[of journalism\] that
encompasses statistical analysis, computer science, visualization and
web design, and reporting'.[^11chapter11_9] The hybridity of data journalism is
given by the combination of different roles and tasks, often carried out
by different actors and not only by journalists. This kind of hybridity
is also reflected in other scholars' definitions: Splendore for instance
emphasizes the combination of storytelling and programming by defining
data journalism as 'a form of storytelling, where traditional
journalistic working methods are mixed with data analysis, programming,
and visualization techniques'.[^11chapter11_10] However, even if many definitions of
data journalism include similar elements such as reporting, programming,
statistics and visualizations, 'an all-encompassing working definition
of data journalism is rather difficult to achieve'.[^11chapter11_11] This is due to
the fact that the field of research is relatively young and, in
addition, scholars from different disciplines such as journalism
studies, communication sciences, informatics or economics are studying
the phenomenon.

Journalism has radically changed in the last twenty years, particularly
with respect to its *openness.* There are different reasons for the
disruption of the 'fortress-journalism'.[^11chapter11_12] One of the first breaches
in the longtime impenetrable walls of the newsrooms was the growing
phenomenon of citizen journalism that understands users not only as
consumers, but also as active producers of information.[^11chapter11_13] This change
in perception contributed to the development of a new journalistic
paradigm that transcends the idea that all aspects of news work are
limited to professional journalists only. Especially the emerging
practice of crowdsourcing - an open call for users to participate in
certain online activities, for instance in collecting information - was
one of the main drivers of participatory forms of journalism.[^11chapter11_14]

These changes in journalism, as Lewis pointed out, triggered the
emergence of an initial form of 'open journalism' based on
contributions, or in the case of catastrophes and emergencies, of an
information *network*.[^11chapter11_15] However, this kind of open journalism relies
more on forms of participation or distributed knowledge in the sense of
Singer et al.: 'People inside and outside the newsroom are engaged in
communicating not only to, but also with, one another. In doing so, they
all are participating in the ongoing processes of creating a news
website and building a multifaceted community'.[^11chapter11_16] Yet, professional
journalism remained resistant to change for a very long time, and
participatory journalism - understood as a shared news production
process between professionals and amateurs - remained an exception
rather than the rule. Williams et al. showed that newsrooms tend to
co-opt participatory practices to suit traditional routines and
ideals.[^11chapter11_17] In other cases, journalists tended to see users simply as
'active recipients' who act only on the grounds of what has been
reported.[^11chapter11_18]

Even if some newsrooms are still hesitant to include participatory
instruments into their news production, or dismissed their collaborative
experiments, there is a growing body of evidence that 'journalism's
ideological commitment to control, rooted in an institutional instinct
toward protecting legitimacy and boundaries, may be giving way to a
hybrid logic of adaptability and openness'.[^11chapter11_19] Lewis and Usher even
note that journalists increasingly find normative purpose in
transparency and participation, a culture that is very similar to the
open-source technology culture,[^11chapter11_20] which is based on a wider
understanding of openness in terms of sharing collected data, being
transparent about their use, and being actively interactive with users
and other journalists.[^11chapter11_21]

This slow change in the adaptation of a culture of openness - to see
users as peers rather than as an amorphous and anonymous group of
consumers or to understand other journalists as colleagues within a
network rather than as competitors - was in part due to the rise of new
technologies such as social media and their affordances and culture
based on participation. One of the most famous social media journalists,
Andy Carvin, once described his own work as 'an open-source newsroom
that anyone can come and participate in, or observe the process'.[^11chapter11_22]
In addition, the slow shift to more open journalism in terms of
transparency, sharing and collaboration across different newsrooms or
divisions may well be due to the entrance of new actors into the core
field of journalism. These actors belong to different professions and
have thus been socialized differently with a different professional
culture.

This process can be well observed in data journalism. Many
quantitatively oriented journalists have a background in informatics,
and only subsequently moved, through learning by doing and by being part
of a data journalism team, to a more journalistically oriented role.
This means that new actors, some of whom have not been influenced and
socialized by journalistic culture in the first place, have now entered
the institutionalized field of journalism, influencing in turn its
practices, routines, professional norms and culture with notions
originating from other professions. Russell has shown how hackers and
hacktivists, among others, are playing an increasingly important role in
shaping contemporary journalism, 'expanding what it means to be involved
in the production of news and, in the process, gaining influence over
how traditional news stories and genres are constructed and
circulated'.[^11chapter11_23]

However, the field of data journalism evolved unevenly both across and
within different media systems, given that news organizations may not be
willing or able to offer the necessary resources in terms of time and
money either to sustain a specialized team or to develop a sufficient
data literacy among their employed journalists - also due to
traditional norms and practices still dominating the newsrooms.[^11chapter11_24]
This means that the openness of data journalism not only depends on the
individual dispositions of journalists, but also on organizational
logics and constraints that may severely limit the specific
implementation of notions such as open source. Nevertheless, openness
has become a new industry standard as professional journalism practice
opens up its boundaries not only to participation in news work, but also
in the search for future opportunities to solve journalism's many
issues.[^11chapter11_25]

One of the main traits of these new actors, mainly technologists,
entering the field is a clear orientation towards the concept of open
source, particularly if their background is in informatics. The general
idea behind the concept of open source is that free sharing,
collaborative production and free distribution produce the best results
in terms of transparency, use and usability, particularly because users
are involved in the production process.[^11chapter11_26] According to the Open
Source Initiative, open source does not only mean allowing access to the
source code. It also means that the distribution of the code must comply
with specific criteria such as free re-distribution, allowing
modifications and derived works, no discrimination against persons,
groups and fields of endeavor, and other aspects.[^11chapter11_27] However, the
concept of open source goes well beyond questions of licensing. Coleman
understands open source as an aspiration towards open programming,
grounded on the philosophical belief in social responsibility through
freedom and openness.[^11chapter11_28]

What makes open source such a captivating concept is its dual
significance both as a guideline for the practical development of
software programming, and the underlying ethos of a culture of free and
open distribution, from which society can benefit. This is why open
source is mainly 'characterized by a non-market, non-contractual
transfer of knowledge among actors, sharing relevant information with a
non-definite set of other actors without any immediate recompense'.[^11chapter11_29]
In this analysis, open source is thus understood as a dual orientation
towards open, transparent and collaborative *production* as well as a
belief in the social responsibility and freedom of sharing and openness
in the *use* of the produced information.

It is in this sense that Lewis and Usher understand open source both as
an 'architectural framework and a cultural context'.[^11chapter11_30] This dual
implication of open source as both *materiality* (what is actually
produced) and *culture* (certain normative values such as the ethos of
sharing without any immediate recompense) is particularly relevant when
it comes to its implementation in journalism: openness and collaboration
are therefore not just to be seen as descriptors of a specific
journalistic practice, but as a moral principle in the sense of an
'ethical volunteerism' and a 'desire for open technologies and a
philosophical belief in serving the public good through openness'.[^11chapter11_31]

Especially in the field of data journalism, where different actors with
diverse backgrounds work together, it is a useful approach in order to
gauge how journalists, newsrooms and news organizations are
collaborating with 'the clear purpose of contributing to a joint
development'.[^11chapter11_32] These collaborations that transcend traditional and
established boundaries contribute to the evolution of the traditional
journalism culture,[^11chapter11_33] up to the point where it is possible to
consider these new forms of reporting relying on data as a 'trading
zone',[^11chapter11_34] where the crossing of professional boundaries occurs not
only more often, but it gets also increasingly accepted. The increasing
collaborative setting of journalism reflects, at the same time, the fact
that open journalism as well as data journalism are both the consequence
- and the cause - of the enlargement of the journalistic field. Deuze
and Witschge pointed out that 'journalism takes place in increasingly
networked settings, in formal as well as informal contexts, involving a
wide range of actors and actants in various instances of both paid and
free labor (...) covering news in real-time across multiplying
platforms, often in competition or collaboration with publics'.[^11chapter11_35]

This groundbreaking transformation of journalism in terms of openness
and collaboration require a broader normative perspective in relation to
the concept of open source. Lewis and Usher developed a specific
framework of four normative values that are necessary to implement the
principles of open source in the journalistic field: transparency,
participation, tinkering, and iteration.[^11chapter11_36]

Applying an open source approach means first of all to be *transparent*
about what one is doing. In the case of journalism it means not only to
be transparent about the coding, but also about the production routines
of journalism. Data and information (also with regard to the adopted
source codes) should be freely shared for others to use. Journalism
itself strives for transparency in society and should therefore act
accordingly, particularly as digital technologies have enhanced the
opportunities of opening up the news production.[^11chapter11_37] However,
transparency as part of an open source concept pushes journalism even
further, as news production becomes both 'liquid' and dynamic: a
continuous, transparent and networked process of information, open to
participation and that can be held accountable by the users.

*Participation* means that the production process is relying on a
distributed network of different contributors. This is also relevant for
ethical frameworks because journalism is shifting from a traditional
gatekeeper ethics towards a relational ethics.[^11chapter11_38] Participation is an
inherent dimension of open source because it relies on the fact that an
increased number of collaborators and collective intelligence produce
better results. Applied to the field of journalism this means that users
have more opportunities to collaborate with professional journalists or
can at least to monitor their work. The role of users becomes therefore
much more active and interlinked with the newsroom.

The normative value of *tinkering* implies playfulness as well as an
inclination towards experimentation. This norm becomes particularly
relevant as journalism gets increasingly networked due to new actors
entering journalism. The result is a form of hybrid journalism, where
different actors such as journalists, hackers or whistleblowing
platforms, with different professional roles and cultures (for instance
in the case of the 'Panama Papers' or the Offshore Leaks) are working
together in the public interest. *Iteration* is a norm closely related
to tinkering and implies 'the freedom to fail'.[^11chapter11_39] While innovation
processes in established news organizations are mostly bound to
centralized and top-down processes, iterative methods focus more
strongly on the process rather than the actual outcome, leaving the
involved actors room for testing. This normative framework is useful to
analyze the ethical challenges of data journalists, given that they are
working in a collaborative, often experimental and transparency-driven
environment.

## The Study

In order to answer the research goal, we carried out several
problem-centered interviews mostly via Skype with 20 data journalists in
Switzerland and Italy between the end of 2015 and the end of 2017.[^11chapter11_40]
The interviews focused on four main areas: their professional career
paths, the production process in relation to collaborations, their
normative perspectives about data journalism, and ethical issues. The
interviews were recorded and subsequently partially transcribed. The
interviewed data journalists are working full-time both for established
news organizations and specialized agencies. The sampling method was
twofold: initially we carried out a desktop research to identify and
collect the names of data journalists currently working in Switzerland
and Italy. We then interviewed specific data journalists and asked the
interviewees to provide us with the names of other data journalists.
This snowball sampling method is suited to analyze well-connected
communities like those of data journalists.[^11chapter11_41]

The comparison between Switzerland and Italy is not only interesting due
to the fact that they belong to different journalistic cultures, but
also because data journalism evolved differently in the two countries.
In Switzerland, data journalism has gradually entered established news
organizations throughout the last couple of years. However, due to the
small Swiss media market, data journalism emerged with a considerable
delay compared to other countries in Europe. In Italy, data journalism
is already a highly professional sub-field, even if the journalistic
education is (still) not well developed. Additionally, data journalism's
origin lies outside the established field of journalism: in the
beginning, data journalists were mainly working for specialized agencies
and not for legacy news media.[^11chapter11_42]

### The Ethics of Transparency

Transparency is a well-established concept in both countries. All
interviewed data journalists declare that one of the core tenets of the
work of data journalists consists in being absolutely transparent about
their practice. However, there are some differences when it comes to the
scope of transparency. Not in every case do Swiss data journalists share
raw data, and neither do they apply complete transparency when it comes
to sharing source codes. Although some newsrooms have a GitHub account,
where other data journalists or interested citizens can access the code,
it is not published for every story. The main reason for not doing so is
twofold: on the one hand data journalists argue that there is only a
limited interest for this information. On the other hand, news
organizations put some constraints to the transparency norm in terms of
sharing raw data and source codes in order to avoid freeriding from
competitors. However, data journalists cover an active role when it
comes to sharing data and fostering a culture of transparency within the
news organization.

In Italy, the transparency norm is universally shared among the
community of data journalists: 'I absolutely agree with the idea of open
journalism. It would be a paradigmatic change in journalism if the
production processes were open and transparent.' (I-J3). This can also
be observed in the specific mention of the relevance of an *open source
approach*. Moreover, for Italian data journalists transparency is a
central issue, which is also reflected in their journalistic role
conception that is, compared to their Swiss colleagues, far more
activist in support of transparency and the availability of open data:
'We want data to analyze!' (I-J1). The clear disposition towards
transparency by granting third parties with complete access to raw
datasets might also be traced back to the fact that most data
journalists in Italy, unlike their Swiss counterparts, have a background
in informatics and were thus socialized in a professional culture that
has fewer issues with openness.

At the same time, the fact that most data journalists have a background
in informatics can become a matter of concern: data journalists might be
forced to handle sensitive data. Most data journalists have never been
trained on how to handle such data and how to protect it from hacking or
surveillance. The same applies to privacy issues that occur in the case
of leaks. The protection of anonymity and of sources cannot always be
guaranteed because most data journalists in both countries have never
been 'educated' in matters of data protection - even if the situation
is slowly changing, also due to the discoveries in the wake of the
Snowden revelations:

'The freelance data journalist does not have the requested skills to
protect the source. This culture in Italy is still rare, but it would be
vital to convince those working in the public administration to have
more trust in journalists and to offer more data.' (I-J3).

Open source can thus become a serious concern in journalism as well.
Particularly nowadays, where journalism is seen as a 'dynamic set of
practices and expectations - a profession in a permanent process of
becoming', both organizations and individuals need to develop a
normative framework that lives up to the standards of a networked,
'liquid' and flexible journalism.

### The Ethics of Participation

Participation implies the collaboration with different actors both
within and across the boundaries of news organizations. The findings
show that Swiss and Italian data journalists apply different strategies
when it comes to the participation of users, but demonstrate similar
beliefs for collaborative newswork within the boundaries of news
organizations. In Switzerland, data journalists declare that
participatory strategies that involve users more actively are not
central, except maybe for the generation of new ideas. Collaborative
strategies like crowdsourcing are thus the exception. With regard to
internal collaborations, many data journalists admitted that they served
somehow as 'troubleshooters' for problems related to informatics,
visuals and, above all, statistics. Even if this is not the form of
collaboration originally intended by the normative framework, it
nevertheless allows data journalists to propagate specific normative
assumptions like transparency within the organization.

In Italy, data journalists specifically rely on the contributions of
users, which are seen as co-constructors of reality. In addition,
collaborations that go beyond the boundaries of the news organizations
are standard. Compared to the Swiss situation, this is easier to
implement because in most cases data journalists in Italy are working
for startups or agencies. These organizations are considerably smaller
than their legacy counterparts and very often collaborations with
external experts are paramount and therefore part of the job. Such
informal collaborations occur also within the newsrooms, given that the
collaborators of the agencies are not exclusively journalists: often
they include hackers, programmers, visualization experts and
statisticians as well. Crossing organizational boundaries is a normal
procedure, something legacy news media in Switzerland are still
struggling with because - even informal - collaborations are often not
tolerated.

### The Ethics of Tinkering

The biggest differences between Switzerland and Italy can be observed
with regard to the norm of tinkering. Given that Swiss data journalism
mainly developed within established news organizations, the room for
experiments is limited compared to startups or agencies, where
experimenting and a drive for innovation is a main motivation. In Italy,
informal collaborations particularly for experimental reasons are
regarded as absolutely central, not only to further develop products and
services, but eventually to stay in business. Such experimental
collaborations are thus fostered either through networks like
Hacks/Hackers or through events like hackathons. There are still
considerable differences with regard to this kind of experimental
collaboration through established networks between Switzerland and
Italy. Nonetheless, Swiss newsrooms started to organize and to
participate in similar events like Hacks/Hackers and hackathons during
the last couple of years.[^11chapter11_43] Even large news organizations in
Switzerland such as Tamedia or the Neue Zürcher Zeitung collaborate with
these networks and offer room for meetings and discussions.

### The Ethics of Iteration

Iteration, or the freedom to fail, presupposes the possibility to
experiment. Even if some news organizations allow and invest in
experiments, the expected outcomes may differ. Compared to most of their
legacy counterparts, small agencies or journalism startups are
considerably better equipped when it comes to experimenting without
expecting tangible results in the first place. It is in the DNA of
startups that they have to continuously evolve and come up with new and
innovative ideas: first to go beyond a culture of resistance, and second
to avoid an innovation gap that might occur more rapidly for established
news organizations that might even detain a quasi-monopolistic status.
Particularly journalism startups with their focus on entrepreneurial
thinking are more used to reflections on how to do things differently -
a rather difficult task in newsrooms of established news media with
their strong focus on daily news production. Italian data journalism
startups and agencies are thus at the forefront when it comes to
implementing strategies that put innovations into place, changing
organizations for the better.

## Conclusion

The chapter offered an insight into whether and how data journalists in
Italy and Switzerland implement four normative principles related to the
ethics of open-source: transparency, participation, tinkering and
iteration. Most issues are not actually related to differences in the
individual moral compass of data journalists, but to the structures they
work within. News organizations in Switzerland tend to organize the work
of their journalists in traditional ways, largely blocking the
development of networks of 'competitor-colleagues'.[^11chapter11_44] While in Italy
data journalists working in agencies are free from such constraints,
established news organizations still struggle to cope with the new and
networked news ecosystem that implies a different approach to the role
of news media in society and the so called gatekeeper ethics. These
structural conditions put serious constraints to the implementation of
an ethical framework based on open source.

The structural constraints can also be observed when it comes to
experimentation in terms of tinkering and iteration. Even if Swiss news
organizations have considerably improved on experimentation for instance
within larger networks such as Hacks/Hackers, there is still a gap in
terms of *entrepreneurial thinking,* particularly among data journalists
working in larger news organizations. The main issue with an
entrepreneurial approach, particularly within traditional news
organizations is the fact that informal collaborations and networks
often transcend the boundaries of news organizations - diminishing the
organizational and managerial control of news work. Nevertheless, both
the more networked approach of Italian agencies as well as the
traditional institutional approach can be successful, as news
organizations in Italy and Switzerland have won Data Journalism Awards
in the past.

However, news organizations cannot be blamed for all the ethical
constraints data journalists are struggling with. Some of them are also
due to missing individual skills that data journalists have never had
the opportunity to learn: data journalists coming from traditional
newsrooms are rarely trained in data protection techniques against
hacking or surveillance. On the other hand, data journalists with an
informatics background might have no problems with openness and
participation, but lack knowledge in journalism ethics with regard to
handling sensitive information. These educational shortcomings entail
ethical issues with regard to data and source protection.

The findings show that the emergence of data journalism within the
institutionalized field of journalism - although some organizational
backfiring - fosters the normative framework of open source. Taking
into account the increasing datafication of journalism - and of society
at large - it is likely to remain here to stay. The concept of open
source offers to journalism, as it gets more networked, the opportunity
to adopt specific values in a news ecosystem that relies more and more
on a participatory digital media culture. In any case, open source has
to be thought of, as Lewis and Usher affirm, as both an architecture and
a culture, that is to say, 'as a structural retooling of news
technologies and user interfaces, and as a normative rearticulation of
what journalism means in a networked media setting'.[^11chapter11_45] In this sense,
open source offers the opportunity to produce *good data journalism.*
