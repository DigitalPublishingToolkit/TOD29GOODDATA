Abstract:   In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the collection, aggregation and automated analysis of information by government and private actors, and in response to this there has been a significant critique regarding what could be termed ‘bad’ data practices in the globalised digital economy. 
In order to paint an alternative, more optimistic but still pragmatic picture of the datafied future, this book examines and proposes ‘good data’ practices, values and principles from an interdisciplinary, international perspective. From ideas of data sovereignty and justice, to manifestos for change and calls for activism, this collection opens a multifaceted conversation on the kinds of futures we want to see, and presents concrete steps on how we can start realising good data in practice.

# 4: The Good, the Bad and the Beauty of 'Good Enough Data'<br />
*Miren Gutiérrez*

**Abstract**

Drawing on the concept of 'good enough data'[^04chapter4_1], which apply to citizen
data collected via sensors this chapter looks critically at data in
'proactive data activism,' understood as a social practice that uses the
data infrastructure politically and proactively to foster social
change.[^04chapter4_2] This chapter examines how data are generated and employed in
proactive data activism, expanding and applying the term 'good enough
data' beyond citizen sensing and the environment. This analysis derives
from a taxonomy of activists based on how they go about obtaining
data.[^04chapter4_3] It offers too an unsentimental view on the failures and
contradictions of data activism regarding the collection, analysis and
communication of data.[^04chapter4_4] The chapter employs the Syrian Archive --an
organization that curates and documents data related to the Syrian
conflict for activism--- as a pivotal case to look at the new standards
applied to data gathering and verification in data activism from the
South, as well as their challenges, so data become 'good enough' to
produce reliable evidence for social change. Data were obtained too
thorough in-depth interviews, fieldwork and empirical observation.

## Introduction

On 25 and 30 March 2017, the town of al-Lataminah, in northern Syria,
suffered two chemical attacks possibly committed by Syrian government
aircraft.[^04chapter4_5] Since 2011, Syria has been engulfed by a multi-sided armed
conflict between forces led by President Bashar al-Assad, together with
its international allies, and other forces opposing both the government
and each other in varying groupings.[^04chapter4_6] International organizations
have blamed the Syrian government, and its ally, Russia, opponent rebel
groups and the coalition led by the United States of human rights
violations,[^04chapter4_7] including attacks with chemical weapons against
civilians. The main forces implicated in the Syrian conflict --that is,
Iran, Russia, Syria and the United States--- are parties to the Weapons
Convention, which entered into force in 1997, prohibiting the
production, possession and use of chemical weapons, and should comply
with its obligations.[^04chapter4_8] However, since 2013, there have been some
forty recorded instances of alleged chemical weapons use in Syria,[^04chapter4_9]
and no mechanism to attribute responsibility exists.[^04chapter4_10]

As with other assaults, the source for the attacks against al-Lataminah
remained unclear until a team of students at the Berkeley Human Rights
Investigation Lab (HRC Lab) went through nine videos uploaded by people
identified as journalists and ordinary citizens on Twitter, YouTube and
Facebook. This analysis suggested that the attacks had indeed involved
chemical weapons and that, at least in the case of the 25 March strike,
the target was a medical facility.[^04chapter4_11] Their report concludes that the
perpetrators were in potential violation of international humanitarian
law, as well as other regulations and treaties.[^04chapter4_12]

Syrian Archive was the supplier of the videos. This organization gathers
visual accounts about human rights violations committed by all sides of
the Syrian conflict.[^04chapter4_13] It was founded in 2014 by human rights
activists with the aim of investigating and preserving digital content
as a form of 'a digital memory' of human rights infringements and
building a corpus of substantiation that could be used for advocacy,
reporting and law cases.[^04chapter4_14] Syrian Archive is sustained by donations
but accepts no money from governments directly involved in the
conflict.[^04chapter4_15]

Syrian Archive could be regarded as a proactive data activist
organization, or activism that employs the data infrastructure
politically and proactively to provide diagnoses and evidence for social
change.[^04chapter4_16] The massive collection and automated analysis of private
data by governments and corporations have generated the emergence of
reactive data activists, who use the data infrastructure to shelter
their interactions from data surveillance.[^04chapter4_17] The chapter is focused
on the data practices employed by the former type of activism, which
embodies a reversal to what Poell, Kennedy and van Dijck call
*dataveillance.*[^04chapter4_18] In the face of discriminatory, opaque or unethical
private data gathered for obscure purposes without people's knowledge or
consent, proactive data activists engage in a variety of methods to
obtain and analyze data, sidestepping conventional data actors and
systems, enhancing their data agency, and correcting the asymmetries
embedded in top-down datafication processes.[^04chapter4_19]

Activists have demonstrated ingenuity in creating data, and can be
classified from the ways they go about obtaining them: from the easiest
way to the most difficult, they can rely on whistleblowers who hand over
datasets anonymously (first type) or resort to public datasets (second);
and when data are not available, create platforms to crowdsource citizen
data (third); appropriate data, becoming whistleblowers themselves
(fourth), and generate data on their own terms, for example, via
data-gathering devices (fifth).[^04chapter4_20]

Syrian Archive combines mainly the second and third kinds of data
extraction methods: it counts on data uploaded by ordinary citizens,
journalists and activists on sharing and social media platforms. That
is, it relies on data that has been made public by people (i.e. a form
of public data). These data have been harvested through platforms which
were not set up by the activists themselves but by social media service
providers (i.e. a form of crowdsourced data). Other data activists
specialize in using just one of these methods.[^04chapter4_21] For example, the
deployers of 'Ayuda Ecuador' --an application of the Ushahidi platform
launched to gather data on the crisis unleashed by the earthquake in
2016 in Ecuador--- established the means to collect data submitted via
mobile technology, emails and websites, using the third type of data
extraction method. Although crowdsourcing citizen data is its main data
mining method, Ushahidi also resorts to data scraping from websites and
social media for verification purposes (i.e. a form of data
appropriation). Meanwhile, the citizen data on air quality Gabrys,
Pritchard and Barratt talk about were gathered via sensors,[^04chapter4_22] namely,
the fifth technique. Data activists are resourceful and often combine
repertoires of action and strategies seeking the best solutions for each
case.

Proactive data activism often relies on good enough data, a concept
coined by Gabrys, Pritchard and Barratt to indicate data created, valued
and interpreted by ordinary people, which these authors apply to
environmental data and citizen sensing.[^04chapter4_23] The good enough data
practices in these authors' study meet the criteria of being a) based on
datasets gathered by ordinary people, b) aimed at creating new types of
data and data stories, and c) useful to generate evidence that can be
employed in decision-making.[^04chapter4_24] This concept pertains to other types
of data activism too, as seen later.

However, data activism is neither pure nor neutral; it embeds some
contradictions and unbalances. For example, like in other deployments of
the Ushahidi platform, 'Ayuda Ecuador' places digital humanitarians
(i.e. the deployers of the application) in the role of gatekeepers of
good enough data as they are the ones enforcing the data authentication
systems and controlling the crisis map. These data asymmetries are
reviewed later too.

To look at good enough data in activism, I rely on fieldwork, empirical
observation of significant cases, a case study, and in-depth interviews
with relevant actors involved in data curation processes from several
organizations. The case study methodology aims at showing how data
practices look like based not on the actors' opinions, but on
evaluations, scientific literature and website content.[^04chapter4_25] Syrian
Archive is a data activist initiative that embodies the highest
standards of data curation in activism. Because of the delicate tasks
they have been set to confront, its managers have developed a meticulous
data protocol, based on international standards, to conserve data so
they are *good enough* to sustain further legal investigations. This is
a single-focused, descriptive study that employs an instance to offer a
common framework for future studies.[^04chapter4_26] Syrian Archive provides a case
of a class of phenomena; that is, activism that utilizes the data
infrastructure for knowledge and action. The case study methodology is
helpful when the boundaries between a phenomenon and its context are not
apparent.[^04chapter4_27] This organization has been chosen based on the fact that
background conditions are relevant to the inspection of data practices
in activism.

Five interviewees --chosen for their in-depth knowledge data practices
and protocols in activism and beyond--- were questioned about their data
mining and curation methodologies. Although the questions vary in line
with their expertise, the questionnaires sent to these practitioners
include open questions such as: 'How can you aspire to data robustness
taking into account that your data sources may have their own agendas?'
The idea behind the interviews is to capture what these interviewees
think they do.[^04chapter4_28] The questions were designed to last for one hour,
and sent by email or formulated in phone discussions. Interviewee 1
works for a crowdsourcing platform that visualizes citizen data for
digital humanitarianism. Interviewee 2 has designed smart grids that
channel data for real-time decision-making in water management.
Interviewees 3 and 4 have an exhaustive knowledge of Syrian Archive. In
charge of an index that ranks countries by their frailty, Interviewee 5
--not a data activist--- has been included here for contrast, as in the
case of Interviewee 2. Although their data methods and approaches vary,
their tenets do not differ so much.

The next sections offer an exploration of data in activism from the
perspective of data, followed by an inspection of Syrian Archive and a
comparison with other initiatives, concluding with a proposed definition
for *good enough data in activism* that can be used as a heuristic tool
in other analyses.

## Perfect Data, Big Data and Small Data

Most researchers, journalists and activists who handle data employ
'small data', namely, data that appears in a volume and format that
makes them usable and analyzable.[^04chapter4_29] In contrast, 'big data' are so
vast and complex that they cannot be managed with traditional data
processing methods.[^04chapter4_30] The big data infrastructure allows the
collection of data and metadata continually, surreptitiously and
comprehensively: every click and every 'like' is stored and analyzed in
real-time.[^04chapter4_31] Big data are understood as 'datasets whose volume,
velocity or variety' is extremely high and show a high degree of
'veracity' and a potential for 'value'.[^04chapter4_32]

The employment of big data techniques can give rise to thought-provoking
insights. For example, Stephens-Davidowitz's *Everybody Lies* explores
how people lie in polls and pretend on social media while removing their
masks when they search for information online.[^04chapter4_33] Based on the massive
analysis of Google searches, other search engines and websites, he
discovers that people are much more racist, sexist and ignoble than they
think or admit.[^04chapter4_34] Big data-based research is revolutionizing not only
surveillance and marketing, but scientific disciplines as well, from
sociology to historiography. For instance, only a few years ago it was
only possible to examine fragments of big *corpora* and science focussed
on getting information from limited fragments.[^04chapter4_35] The study of the
13^th^ century Korean Buddhist canon, which contains 52 million
characters distributed across 166,000 pages, is an example; with data
analytics, the whole text can now be interrogated in its totality in
every search.[^04chapter4_36] Are big data, then, better data, as Cukier
argues?[^04chapter4_37] The simple answer is: not necessarily. Data *goodness*
depends on the quality of both the data and processes involved to
analyze them, as well as on the purpose of the analysis. Namely, it is
not a question only of quantity, but also of quality and intent.

No matter how big, data can never be perfect because they cannot be
raw.[^04chapter4_38] Borges's tale of frustrated mapmakers could be read as a
warning about the impossibility of perfect science, or data.[^04chapter4_39] In
'On Exactitude in Science,' Borges speaks about an empire where
pursuing scientific authenticity, cartographers made maps as big as the
land they portrayed, whereupon these charts failed to be useful and were
forgotten.[^04chapter4_40] The same way that 'the map is not the territory',[^04chapter4_41]
data cannot be considered 'straightforward representations of given
phenomena'.[^04chapter4_42] Data are not free of ideology, as they do not emerge
free of the views, methods and technologies of the people that conceive,
generate, process, curate, analyze and store them.[^04chapter4_43] Data are not
natural but *cultural resources* 'cooked' in processes of collection and
use, which are also 'cooked',[^04chapter4_44] thus, they can embed biases, gaps and
asymmetries. As Interviewee 5 notes, 'every qualitative data source is
arguably open to bias.' Paraphrasing Gitelman,[^04chapter4_45] *perfect data* is
another oxymoron.

Errors and biases can be introduced accidentally in data processes. An
artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm learned to associate women with
kitchen images because more women appear photographed in kitchens on the
web.[^04chapter4_46] In the process of *learning*, the algorithm then multiplied
the bias present in the initial dataset, amplifying --not simply
replicating--- the biased association between kitchens and women.[^04chapter4_47]
This study by the University of Virginia is among several others that
recently show that artificial intelligence systems can incorporate, and
even multiply, biases if their design or the data on which they are
based are not revised carefully.

Besides, data can also be manipulated. Edward Snowden's 2013
revelations include examples of big data-based manipulation; they
showed that the intelligence services of the US government, with the
collaboration of companies and other governments, had established a
dense layer of surveillance and data interception on the communications
of millions of people globally without their knowledge.[^04chapter4_48] More
recently, it was revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics
firm, had collaborated with Donald Trump's election team in 2016 to
harvest millions of Facebook profiles of US voters to design
personalized campaign messages for them.[^04chapter4_49] Critical scholars,
including Braman,[^04chapter4_50] Tufekci,[^04chapter4_51] and Gangadharan,[^04chapter4_52] describe how
big data techniques are employed to profile people, discriminate against
vulnerable groups and promote relentless, omnipresent and preventive
monitoring. In *Weapons of Math Destruction*, O\'Neil presents too that
data-based programs increase the efficiency of 'predatory advertising'
that undermines democracy.[^04chapter4_53]

This paper's aim is not to determine the difference between *good* and
*good enough* because to do that, and it would have to establish first
the philosophical question of the meaning *good*, over which there is no
consensus. Gabrys, Pritchard and Barrat do not fathom what *good*
means related to data either.[^04chapter4_54] Thus, good enough is to be initially
understood as robust enough - devoid of significant unfair or impairing
manipulation - to sustain research for socially beneficial purposes.
Coming back to Cukier's assertion,[^04chapter4_55] it seems that instead of asking
how big our datasets are to determine whether they are good, we should
start by asking first 'for what', as Robert Staughton Lynd suggested
about science,[^04chapter4_56] and then look for data and processes that are strong
enough to support such research.

## Good Enough Data

Data analysis is not for everyone. In a show of enthusiasm, Rogers
compared data analysis with punk music in 2012 because 'anyone can do
it'.[^04chapter4_57] Unfortunately, this is not the case. Not only are data not
available to anyone, but, as Innerarity points out ,[^04chapter4_58] the tools to
make them useful are not available to anyone either. However, the
barriers to access both data and their infrastructure --understood as
the software, hardware and processes necessary to render them useful---
have been falling in recent years.[^04chapter4_59] Activists of all stripes are
using data, in combination with the geoweb, satellite technology,
sensing devices and information and communication technologies (ICTs),
to create datasets and generate diagnoses and social change, as I have
considered elsewhere.[^04chapter4_60] Examples abound. Forensic Architecture,
supported by Amnesty International, has created an interactive model of
Syria\'s most notorious prison, Saydnaya, using the memories of sounds
narrated by survivors who had been kept captive in the dark. The project
aims to show the conditions inside the prison.[^04chapter4_61] WeRobotics employs
'community drones' to collect data on the conditions of glaciers in
Nepal to analyze the data and launch alarms when there is the danger of
flash floods.[^04chapter4_62] InfoAmazonia, among other things, has published a
calendar that superimposes the time counted by the Indigenous peoples of
the Tiquié River, Brazil, and the time measured in the Gregorian
calendar, in a dialogue between the local and the global that never
existed before.[^04chapter4_63] Meanwhile, the Ushahidi platform is deployed to
generate crisis maps that can visualize citizen data in quasi-real-time
to assist humanitarian operations. Namely, when data are not available,
people and organizations create them.

Gabrys, Pritchard and Barratt refer to 'just good enough' data generated
by non-experts to gauge pollution.[^04chapter4_64] Citizen data are often good
enough to produce 'patterns of evidence' that can mobilize community
responses to connect with regulators, request follow-up monitoring, make
a case for improved regulation and accountability, and keep track of
exposures both on an individual and collective level.[^04chapter4_65] Although
these authors imply citizen sensing and environmental data gathering,
the concept of good enough data can be applied to other areas where
citizens and organizations are creating their own datasets, robust
enough to generate new types of data and data practices, and impactful
bottom-up narratives. The same way that alternative journalism argues
that different forms of knowledge may be generated, representing
'multiple versions of reality from those of the mass media',[^04chapter4_66] good
enough data -- as an alternative to conventional big data - can produce
trustworthy analysis and visualizations which shed light on complex
issues and are the basis for action. The examples of Syrian Archive,
Forensic Architecture, WeRobotics, InfoAmazonia and Ushahidi show that,
beyond citizen sensing, activists can produce reliable results based on
good enough data in the areas of human rights evidence, crisis mapping
and alert systems, and advocacy. The selection of these cases - based on
the complexity in their data processes - draws from my previous work on
data activism.[^04chapter4_67]

That is not to say that data in activism is devoid of inconsistencies.
Some Ushahidi deployments, for instance, have been set up and then
abandoned,[^04chapter4_68] creating a cyber-graveyard of 'dead Ushahidi' maps for
lack of communities reporting data.[^04chapter4_69] Also, Ushahidi's verification
system has not forestalled some glitches, with on-the-ground
consequences.[^04chapter4_70] Besides, data activist projects often resort to
proprietary, corporate inventions, with entrenched imbalances and
harmful practices (i.e. semi-slave labor in the extraction of the cobalt
needed in smartphones),[^04chapter4_71] which are then embedded in the
initiative.[^04chapter4_72] Data processes in activism can also include asymmetries
in the relationships established within their networks, integrating
their own 'power inequalities, unbalances and mediations'.[^04chapter4_73] The
interviewees in this study admit that faulty datasets must be corrected.
However, constant verification allows imperfect datasets to improve and
lead to alternative and useful insights.

Summarizing, good enough data in activism could be explained as data,
however flawed, which are obtained, gathered, curated and analyzed by
citizens and activists through procedures aimed at generating
action-oriented analysis for beneficial social change and
humanitarianism. This definition is reviewed later.

## Syrian Archive

In 2016, Syrian Archive team verified 1748 videos and published a report
pointing to an 'overwhelming' Russian participation in the bombardment
and airstrikes against civilians in the city of Aleppo, Syria.[^04chapter4_74]
Although all parties have perpetrated violations, the visual evidence
demonstrated that the Russian forces were accountable for the largest
amount of violations in Aleppo.[^04chapter4_75] Meanwhile, the Office of the UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) issued a carefully phrased
statement in which it blamed 'all parties to the Syrian conflict' of
perpetrating violations resulting in civilian casualties, although it
also admitted that 'government and pro-government forces' (i.e. Russian)
were attacking hospitals, schools and water stations.[^04chapter4_76] The
difference in language could be attributed to the attitude of a
non-governmental organization compared with that of a UN agency, which
has to collaborate with governments to be able to function. However, the
contrast in data methodologies may also be at the bottom of what each
said about the bombings. While the OHCHR report was based on interviews
with people after the events, Syrian Archive relied on video evidence
mostly uploaded by people on social media without the intervention of
the non-profit (although some video evidence was sent directly to Syrian
Archive).[^04chapter4_77]

The traditional practices of evidence gathering in human rights law 'is
grounded in witness interviews often conducted well after the
fact'.[^04chapter4_78] Even if surveys and interviews offer crucial information
about armed conflicts, the violence can shape responses 'in ways that
limit their value'.[^04chapter4_79] Namely, the distortions that violence can
elicit in the witnesses' testimonies and the time-lapse between the
facts and the interviews can affect the reliability of an inquest. The
medialization of conflicts makes the new activist's data gathering
techniques relevant. Syrian Archive does not only resort to what victims
and witnesses say they remember, but they also rely on what witnesses
*recorded as events unfolded* in real-time. Most of the evidence
included in Syrian Archive report on Aleppo was mentioned in the OHCHR
report, but the non-profit also found new evidence that had not been
cited before.[^04chapter4_80]

Syrian Archive's methodology used in carrying out the Aleppo bombings
research include the identification, collection and preservation of
data, followed by two layers of confirmation with increasing depth.[^04chapter4_81]
Syrian Archive has identified three hundred sources in Syria - including
media organizations and citizen journalists - and checked their
reliability by tracking them and examining their social media accounts
over time.[^04chapter4_82] The organization is aware of the fact that these sources
are 'partisan' and require 'caution', and that is why it also relies on
other groups of sources, which offer additional information.[^04chapter4_83]

When Syrian Archive obtains a video, the first thing is to save it;
next, the identity of the source of the video is verified with the
on-the-ground network. Then, the source's track record is examined
looking at whether the source has posted other videos from the same
location or different locations.[^04chapter4_84].As investigative reporters
counting on deep throats, Syrian Archive does not scrutinize the
sources' motivations, as Interviewee 4 notes:

> We don't care about their agendas. What we are trying to do here is to
> look at the content itself, and cross-reference the content with
> hundreds of thousands of other contents to conclude whether it is true
> or not. We are aware of the types of problems that our sources endure
> (for example blockages by the Syrian government), but we do not look
> at that. As much as we can understand limitations for sources, our job
> is to verify the contents.

Subsequently, the recording is examined to establish its location using
methods that can include the identification of a natural feature of the
landscape (e.g. a line of trees) and buildings and landmarks (e.g. a
mosque's minaret).[^04chapter4_85] Syrian Archive compares the footage with
satellite images from Google Earth, Microsoft Bing, OpenStreetMap,
Panoramio or DigitalGlobe, and looks at the metadata from the video,
which also can provide information about its whereabouts. The video is
then compared with the testimonies of witnesses interviewed by
trustworthy media outlets and human rights organizations. Videos in
Arabic are also scrutinized to determine the dialect and location to
which they might be linked. When possible, Syrian Archive contacts the
source directly to confirm the location and teams up with organizations
specialized in verifying images, such as Bellingcat.[^04chapter4_86] The materials
are categorized using the classification of human rights abuses issued
by the UN, which includes, among others, 'massacres and other unlawful
killings', 'arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention' and
'hostage-taking'.[^04chapter4_87] On Syrian Archive website, information is
classified by the kind of weapon utilized, the location or the kind of
violation or abuse. Figure 2 summarizes the process.

*Figure 2: Syrian Archive digital evidence workflow.[^04chapter4_88]*

Based on the examination of footage, the research of the Aleppo bombings
from July to December 2016 includes overwhelming evidence of 'unlawful
attacks,' illegal weapons, attacks against civilians, humanitarian
workers, journalists and civilian facilities such as hospitals,
schools or markets, and the use of incendiary and cluster
munitions.[^04chapter4_89] Given that rebel groups and terrorist militias like the
Islamic State do not have air forces, Syrian Archive concludes that
most of the airstrikes are carried out by Russian aircraft.[^04chapter4_90] Figure
3 shows a static snapshot of the location of verified attacks; the
interactive chart available online allows users to access the videos
that sustain it.

December 2016).[^04chapter4_91]*

Syrian Archive exhibits the ingenuity that characterizes data activists;
however, not all data activist initiatives employ the same data methods.
Next, the commonalities in good enough data gathering practices are
examined. First, Syrian Archive's data are inspected through the lens of
the criteria for 'just good enough data' (see Table 1).[^04chapter4_92] Second,
based on the taxonomy of data gathering methods offered earlier,[^04chapter4_93]
several data activist initiatives are compared with Syrian Archive
looking at the variety of data mining approaches they employ (see Table
2). And third, how the interviewees themselves definite 'good enough' is
explored to extract more insights.

## Comparison and discussion

### Meeting the criteria for 'good enough'

First, Gabrys, Pritchard and Barratt refer to datasets generated by
citizens, that is, ordinary people understood as non-experts.[^04chapter4_94]
Meanwhile, although based on citizen data, the team at Syrian Archive
includes 'researchers, journalists, technologists and digital security
experts who have been working in the field of human rights,
verification, open source technologies and investigation methodologies
for the past ten years'.[^04chapter4_95] According to the Syrian Archive's
protocols, experts determine the data rules, and ordinary people
(citizen journalists and contributors) and other experts (conventional
journalists) provide the data from the ground. At face value, this
constitutes a difference. However, Gabrys, Pritchard and Barratt also
acknowledge that expert mediation was required in citizen data sensing
'given the disjuncture between the expertise needed to analyze the data
and the researchers' and residents' skills in undertaking data
analysis'.[^04chapter4_96] Namely, good enough data analysis involved citizens but
requires a degree of expertise. However, the 'good enough' condition
does not depend on distinctions between ordinary people and experts:
data are either good enough or not. Gabrys, Pritchard and Barratt note
'regulators, scientists and polluters' have attempted 'to discredit
citizen data' due to concerns about their know-how.[^04chapter4_97] Nevertheless,
as they also say, 'questions about validity do not pertain to citizen
data alone'.[^04chapter4_98] Thus, the level of expertise of either data gatherers
or data interpreters does not seem to be relevant as long as the data
are robust.

Second, Syrian Archive provides new types of data and data stories,
since no other actor, official or not, is producing them. Likewise,
Gabrys, Pritchard and Barratt suggest that the citizens involved in the
data sensing exercises are compelled to act by the absence of
information and institutional support;[^04chapter4_99] that is, they are filling a
gap. This is the case of Syrian Archive too; for instance, the official
UN report on Aleppo shows only part of the story. This characteristic
has to do with the ability of data activists of crafting alternative
maps, stories and solutions.[^04chapter4_100] The purpose of filling gaps suggests
that there is a particular amount of information needed to tell a human
rights story accurately, and that activism can help secure this
information. That is why good enough data implies to the right amount of
data --not necessarily big--- that activists needs to produce.

Third, as the Aleppo investigation suggests, the result of the analysis
of the video footage was useful to generate new 'forms of evidence',
paraphrasing Gabrys, Pritchard and Barratt,[^04chapter4_101] which were good enough
to reveal a Russian or Syrian intervention in the bombing of the city.
Thus, good enough data can be evidential data, since they can satisfy
the need to provide sufficient support for ongoing legal investigations.

This paper proposes a new criterion. To be deemed good enough, data
should also be suitable for the goals of the initiative in which the
data are being employed, as Interviewee 3 suggests:

> What is good enough data depends on the purpose of what you are doing
> (...) (For Syrian Archive) the dataset in question has to be the
> result of an investigation, it has to be cross-referenced, the product
> of a collaboration, it has to be in a standardized form if it comes
> from different platforms and media types, and it has to be preserved
> to be handed over for legal accountability and the end user, for
> example, a UN report.

It might be said that Syrian Archive's long-term mission is to promote
social change in Syria, but there are various means by which change
might be promoted. Syrian Archive goes about fulfilling its mission in
its own way: producing evidence of abuses that can withstand examination
in court. The nature of what counts as 'good enough' data is
*unavoidably* contextual. The data in the Syrian Archive are good enough
to show that there are human rights violations in the military
conflict. It appears we cannot ask whether a pertinent dataset is good
enough without further formulating the specific use to which the data
will be put; that is, without stipulating a) the specific role the data
play in how change is to be fostered, and b) what change is to be
advanced. The question of whether data are 'good enough' must be framed
by the context in which the data are being used; it should respond to
the question 'what for'. And Syrian Archive's data are good enough for
the purposes of the organization, while they are new and are generating
alternative data stories and evidence that can be the basis for court
cases.

### How Syrian Archive fares in comparison with other cases

Data activists can resort to different data methods. Table s shows how
Syrian Archive compares with the other cases mentioned before. The
purpose of this table is to spell out the different origins, type of
data activism and means to understand good enough data more broadly and
provide a taxonomy that can be used as a tool to enhance the
comparability of case studies.

<br />*Table 1: Comparison of Data Initiatives by Their Origins[^04chapter4_102]*

Forensic Architecture employs advanced architectural and media research
on behalf of international prosecutors, human rights organizations and
campaigning groups to produce evidence of human rights abuses.[^04chapter4_103]
WeRobotics launches 'flying labs' and swimming robots to capture data
and images for social uses.[^04chapter4_104] Focused on promoting conservation via
data transparency, InfoAmazonia visualizes journalistic stories and
advocacy content on maps, sets up sensor networks to capture water data,
creates alarm systems and crowdsources data from indigenous
communities.[^04chapter4_105] Meanwhile, Ushahidi has created a crowdsourcing
platform that gathers, verifies and visualizes citizen data to support
humanitarian operations.[^04chapter4_106] One difference can be identified looking
at their data sources is that, while the people who submit documents on
social media may not know they are going to be used by Syrian Archive,
the reporters of the Ushahidi platform and the citizens gathering data
via sensors are creating data deliberately as part of the effort from
its inception. The act of documenting a case of abuse and sharing the
video may reveal an intention to denounce it and an acceptance that the
information can be used by third parties, but it is not a given.
Interviewees 3 and 4 say that some reporters send the footage directly
to the organization; however, part of the Syrian Archive reporters'
involvement in the project is indirect.

In any case, these initiatives rely wholly or partially on citizens, and
the interviews illustrate the importance of citizen data for their
projects. Talking about Syrian Archive Interviewee 3 puts it like this:

> (Syrian) footage gathered by ordinary citizens and journalists and
> posted online has started to appear as evidence in courtrooms. In
> August 2017, the International Criminal Court used a video posted on
> YouTube to get an international arrest warrant on an officer of the
> Libyan army accused of war crimes. Open information obtained from
> social media is increasingly recognized in court as potential
> evidence, which is really encouraging.

Interviewee 1 notes that the high value of citizen data in crisis
mapping employed in digital humanitarianism:

> Especially in times of disaster, the best people to give direction on
> what is needed on the ground are the people directly affected by the
> crisis, the otherwise assumed to be "passive recipients" of
> information.

Even the two non-activist interviewees integrate some forms of citizen
data in their projects. Although the fragile states index does not
incorporate them 'because it is too difficult to verify at that high
level', social media or citizen data are part of 'more ground-level,
localized community assessments', says Interviewee 5. The water grids
designed to distribute water in cities and communities by Interviewee 2
employ user data to identify loss and malfunction within the grids.

However, there is a distinction to be made when the lens of volume and
data roles are taken into account. In the case of Syrian Archive and
Forensic Architecture, citizen data are incorporated on a case by case
basis; WeRobotics, Ushahidi, InfoAmazonia and citizen sensing integrate
citizens not only as data gatherers but also as analyzers and users.

Another trend that can be spotted is the alternative use practitioners
make of data-harvesting technologies. For example, while drones -
crewless aerial vehicles - were created originally for military
purposes, they have been appropriated by WeRobotics and other data
activists for social and humanitarian uses. Likewise, maps have been
traditionally the monopoly of the state; these organizations and
projects have seized them to generate alternative narratives and oppose
top-down approaches.[^04chapter4_107] The same observations can be made about the
data infrastructure being employed in activism, not its primary purpose.
That is, these data practices not only generate new datasets and data
stories; they also reverse top-down approaches to the data
infrastructure.

### The interviewees: Verification and usefulness

What else can be said about good enough data? Next, the interviewees
provide more clues as to what is good enough. For example, Interviewee 1
notes something that appears obvious: data have to be accurate to be
valuable. To make sure this is the case, data practitioners resort to
verification processes with a variety of techniques, which are, again,
context related.

> Verification mechanisms (...) vary from one deployment to another,
> depending on the context and intensity of the situation. Children
> mapping out the cost of chicken across the world will have a less
> rigorous verification process as compared to election monitors in
> Kenya. In most cases, verification will involve corroboration with
> trusted sources online, and on the ground, and mainstream media
> sources (...) I think the definition of good enough data is something
> that can only be determined from one deployment to another. Is it
> relevant to the topic of interest/goal of your deployment? Do the
> submissions give you enough information to act? 

Interviewee 2 also highlights the fact that, while good enough data is a
relative concept, all data have to be standardized and validated to be
usable:

> Good enough data is really a moving target. Each data submission (...)
> can lead to new, unsupported data that needs to be analyzed and added
> to our *raw* input data validation and normalization stage. We also need
> to have a data QA stage that extracts statistics that let us inspect
> incoming data and adjust accordingly. Our definition of good data
> could be: It passes our initial raw input data validation filters;
> it's normalized to our system\'s internal requirements; it doesn't
> produce abnormalities in data QA (quality assurance) statistics,
> and it fits into each of the system's internal data structures.

Interviewees 1, 2 and 4 suggest that what is good enough today, can
become *not so good* tomorrow, and that this is a work in progress. The
interviewees imply too that achieving good enough data is a collective
effort that requires meticulous team-work. Interviewee 4 adds the
concepts of comparability and accessibility, as well as the requirement
to integrate feedback to correct errors and avoid misinformation:

> Good enough data are data that have been verified and offered in an
> accessible and standardized, easy manner, which can collaborate with
> other types of data. It is also important that they are accessible, so
> potential problems are fixed through feedback. We see people working
> regarding collecting data (on human rights) based on published data
> but without any criteria of verification. The risk there is to spread
> propaganda.

Syrian Archive devotes significant resources to verify not only the data
but also the data sources. Likewise, Interviewee 5 points out the need
to rely on credible sources to apply verification tests.

> It is basically a reasonability test. In assessing 178 countries on
> such a broad breadth of indicators every year, it is impossible to
> directly verify every one of the 50 million or so data points that we
> analyze. To that degree, a certain amount of trust is necessary for
> the credibility of the sources included in the sample by the content
> aggregation process. The data may never be perfect; however, our
> process of triangulation with different types of data is a way of
> 'balancing' it and ensuring it is providing reasonable outputs.

The interviewees stress the demand for data to be enough in quantity and
accurate, which requires verification processes that integrate
corrections back into the system. Some of them use similar methods. For
example, the triangulation in the vulnerable countries index resembles
Syrian Archive's process in that the latter includes three layers of
data identification and confirmation as well. These interviews add new
perspectives on the concept of good enough data: data should be
standardized and comparable so they can endure verification processes,
they should employ trustworthy sources and embed the capacity for
absorbing corrections.

### Towards a definition of good enough data in activism 

Building blocks that emerge from the comparisons, interviews and
definitions above include: good enough data in activism can/should: 1)
be robust enough in quantity and quality; 2) refer to forms of citizens'
involvement as data gatherers and other roles; 3) generate
impact/action-oriented new data and data stories; 4) involve alternative
uses of the data infrastructure and other technologies, and a variety of
mining methods; 5) resort to credible data sources; 6) include
standardization, comparability, accessibility, usability and accuracy,
as well as verification, testing and feedback integration processes; 7)
involve collaboration; 8) be relevant for the context and aims of the
research questions; and 9) be preserved for further use, including as
evidence in court cases.

The comparison between the reports on Aleppo issued by Syrian Archive
and by OHCHR, and between activist and non-activist data gathering
exercises show that data activism has potential to produce good enough
data to generate dependable information, filling gaps, complementing and
supporting other actors' efforts and, paraphrasing Gabrys, Pritchard and
Barratt,[^04chapter4_108] creating patterns of actionable evidence that can
mobilize policy changes, community responses, follow-up monitoring, and
improved accountability.
