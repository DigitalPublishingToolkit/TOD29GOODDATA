Abstract:   In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the collection, aggregation and automated analysis of information by government and private actors, and in response to this there has been a significant critique regarding what could be termed ‘bad’ data practices in the globalised digital economy. 
In order to paint an alternative, more optimistic but still pragmatic picture of the datafied future, this book examines and proposes ‘good data’ practices, values and principles from an interdisciplinary, international perspective. From ideas of data sovereignty and justice, to manifestos for change and calls for activism, this collection opens a multifaceted conversation on the kinds of futures we want to see, and presents concrete steps on how we can start realising good data in practice.

# 8: Not as Good as Gold? Genomics, Data and Dignity

*Bruce Baer Arnold and Wendy Elizabeth Bonython*

**Abstract**

Genomics enables us to read individuals and populations as abstractions
-- repositories of genetic data rather than persons. Through that lens
it is tempting to regard 'good data' as a matter of what is big
(comprehensive) and better (more accurate), rather than considering
whether it is beneficial to or respectful of its human contributors. As
nations move swiftly to whole-of-population data collection, analysis
and sharing, this chapter suggests that construing bigger and better
data as necessarily beneficial to people is contrary to the dignity that
is central to personhood. From both a bioethics and legal perspective we
are often asking the wrong questions about 'good data'. The chapter
critiques contemporary genomic initiatives such as the Genographic
Project, Ancestry.com, deCODE and 23andMe in arguing it is imperative to
consider meaningful consent regarding data collection and use, alongside
establishment of a genomic commons that addresses problems inherent in
propertization of the genome through patent law. Public and private
goods can be fostered through regulation that ensures data quality and
an information framework centred on public education about genomic data,
encouraging responsible use of data within and across national borders.
If the genome is 'the book of life' we must ensure that 'good' data is
available to all and is understood rather than monopolized, mishandled
or misread.

## Introduction

The genomics revolution -- opening, understanding and manipulating 'the
book of life' -- results in fruitful questions about 'good data',
dignity, ethics and law.[^08chapter8_1]

They are fruitful because they require engagement with issues that
extend beyond diagnostics, therapeutic practice and the interaction of
life-sciences research with business.[^08chapter8_2] They are also fruitful because
they can be addressed through reference to past philosophical inquiries
by figures such as Kant and Locke and to instances such the exploitation
of vulnerable people in Nazi Germany and Jim Crow America where
scientific ends were deemed to justify outrageous means.

We live in a world where there is excitement about genomic tools such as
CRISPR,[^08chapter8_3] where governments are endorsing the establishment of
population-scale health databases to facilitate advances in public
health while strengthening national champions in an emerging global
bioeconomy,[^08chapter8_4] where corporations such as Myriad are exploiting genomic
patents,[^08chapter8_5] and where consumers are unwarily gifting familial data to
private sector initiatives such as 23andMe[^08chapter8_6] or Ancestry.com.[^08chapter8_7]

In that world it is pertinent to examine assumptions about the nature,
derivation and use of genomic data. Such an examination offers an
opportunity for thinking about ways in which potential harms can be
minimized, so that data functions as a social good rather than as a
commodity subject to data strip-mining.[^08chapter8_8] It also offers an
opportunity to think about personhood. Most saliently, in an age of Big
Data and algorithmic governance are individuals: people who must be
respected, or commodities that can be mined by the artificial persons
that we characterize as corporations and governments, creations that
exist to foster our flourishing?[^08chapter8_9]

This chapter accordingly considers 'good data' -- and good data practice
-- through a lens of genomics. The chapter initially discusses genomics
as a way of seeing that enables us to read individuals and populations
as abstractions: repositories of genetic data (and hence potential
susceptibilities, disorders and even behavioural traits) rather than
persons. Through that lens it is tempting for the researcher to regard
'good data' as a matter of what is big (comprehensive) and better (more
accurate) and commodifiable through law that provides patent holders
with exclusive rights. As nations move swiftly to whole-of-population
data collection, analysis and sharing, the chapter suggests that
construing bigger and better as necessarily beneficial to people is
contrary to the dignity that is central to personhood.[^08chapter8_10] From both a
bioethics and legal perspective, typically centred on property rights,
we are often asking the wrong questions about 'good data'. 'Bigger' and
'better' may be beneficial from a data perspective; without an adequate
ethical and legal framework, however, those benefits will not
necessarily be extended to its human contributors.

The chapter accordingly critiques contemporary genomic initiatives such
as Ancestry.com, National Geographic's Genographic Project,[^08chapter8_11]
deCODE[^08chapter8_12] and 23andMe in arguing it is imperative to consider
meaningful consent regarding data collection and use, alongside
establishment of a genomic commons that addresses problems inherent in
propertization of the genome through patent law. Public and private
goods can be fostered through regulation that ensures data quality and
an information framework centred on public education about genomic data,
encouraging responsible use of data within and across national borders.

The chapter concludes by arguing that if the genome is 'the book of
life' we must ensure that 'good' data is available to all and is
understood rather than monopolized, mishandled or misread. Goodness may
be fostered by respectful clinical protocols, best practice on the part
of research funders/regulators and enhanced awareness on the part of
consumers rather than merely by exclusions under intellectual property
law or an international agreement regarding genetic privacy and genomic
rights.[^08chapter8_13]

## You are Data

Valorization of humans as entities deserving respect, a status often
characterized as dignity and differentiated from other life forms, is a
feature of Western philosophy and debate about political economy.[^08chapter8_14]
Kant saliently articulated a categorical imperative that condemned
treatment of people as means to a political or other end.[^08chapter8_15] After
World War Two and the Nuremberg trials, the value of the personhood has
been formally recognized through development of binding codes of ethical
research and practice entrenching respect for the dignity and autonomy
of people as patients and research participants, for example.[^08chapter8_16]
Movements in psychosocial medicine, for example, reflect the ideal of
treating patients as a whole, rather than as an embodiment of discrete
conditions that happen to be stored in a common vessel.[^08chapter8_17]

Conversely, nation states have long read individuals and communities in
terms of gender, social status, military capability, religious
affiliation, age, ethnicity, lineage, tax liability, criminality and
nationality.[^08chapter8_18] Some of those attributes are innate. Some are mutable.
Many can be subverted or evaded. Information tools such as the
population census, initially often crude head counts mapped to specific
locations, have been supplemented through technologies that collect
biometric data in forms such as fingerprints and mugshots.[^08chapter8_19]

The aggregation, rapid sorting and interpretation of such data will be
increasingly pervasive as public and private sector entities across the
globe deploy sophisticated algorithms for biometric data analysis (for
example at international airports and other transport nodes),[^08chapter8_20] and
leverage communication networks that foster the sharing of data between
diverse government agencies and private sector proxies.[^08chapter8_21]

A rich scholarly literature over the past forty years has identified
privacy and other dignitarian concerns regarding the identification of
citizens and non-citizens -- the latter being potentially especially
vulnerable as people situated outside the law that protects their
citizen peers -- as data subjects. Those subjects are entities that are
administered as and because they are manifestations of specific
attributes rather than as individuals who are more than a social
security number, a tax file number, an affirmative action tag or an
entry on a national security watch list. In essence they are
depersonalized, made subordinate to their embodiment of a particular
type of data.

Such abstraction is inherent in 'seeing like a state',[^08chapter8_22] a practice
that embodies inescapable tensions about data and data subjects.
Abstraction fosters the bureaucratic rationality, discussed below, that
is a salient feature of the modern state and more broadly of
modernity.[^08chapter8_23] Like is treated alike. Decisions are made on the basis
of facts (that is, what are deemed to be value-free data). Entitlements
and disabilities are addressed on the basis of shared identity with
other members of a cohort, rather than on the basis of an
administrator's whim or personal values. Increasingly, decisions may be
made by algorithms without any direct human intervention.[^08chapter8_24]

An inflection point in our identification and potential understanding of
human animals and other life forms came in the 1950s with discoveries
regarding DNA, notably publication by Watson and Crick regarding the
'double helix', the code found in all people and characterized by some
scholars as the 'book of life'.[^08chapter8_25] It is a book that contrary to
tabloid enthusiasm about genetics still contains many secrets: we can
see the letters but still struggle to read the syntax and the
meaning.[^08chapter8_26]

An implication of genomics is that we can abstractly construe people as
genetic files. Using a genomic lens you are, for example, a set of
genomic data. You are a file that came into being at conception and that
will be relatively stable throughout your life, reflected in comments
that although you can change your name, nationality and gender you
cannot change your genes.[^08chapter8_27] Your genomic data represents genes that
may determine your life-span, susceptibility to specific medical
disorders and potential as a champion athlete rather than merely your
hair color, gender and skin pigmentation.[^08chapter8_28]

As a file your data can be primarily be isolated from a blood or other
biological sample. It can be expressed in a way that enable analysis and
facilitate the transmission of data across jurisdictions and between
discrete databases or users. It also facilitates comparison with data
relating to other people. That identification is something that is
increasingly automated. It is a practice that is routinized in
applications such as paternity testing or forensic analysis regarding
homicides and sexual assaults, with DNA testing for example replacing
fingerprint testing as a trope in popular culture.[^08chapter8_29] Such
identification seeks to differentiate one person from another or to
confirm a questioned identity through reference to data embodied in a
crime scene sample or a law enforcement register of
offenders/suspects.[^08chapter8_30]

Genomic good data, for some law enforcement personnel, is accordingly a
comprehensive digital biobank that is parsed in order to point to a
suspected offender, providing a basis for specific investigation and
potentially offering what courts regard as conclusive evidence. It is
good because it enables law enforcement and facilitates justice.[^08chapter8_31]

Genomics is not, however, restricted to authoritative differentiation
between yourself, your neighbor and any other reader of this chapter. If
we think of you as a living file of genetic data, a physical embodiment
or expression of instructions, potentials and disabilities in your
genetic code, we should be unsurprised that insurers, developers of
diagnostic tools and pharmaceuticals, public policymakers, behavioral
scientists, epidemiologists and other medical researchers are interested
in what the genome can tell us about health and what opportunities it
provides for medicine, personalized or otherwise. Governments are
endorsing population-scale genomic initiatives alongside private
ventures such as 23andMe that are marketed as recreational
genomics.[^08chapter8_32] Such activity is complemented by public and private
sector plans, notably in the United Kingdom and Israel, to share
population-scale health records -- for example data about everyone who
has attended a hospital or general practitioner in England under the
National Health Service. Recent studies have also identified health data
and health institutions as key targets for cyberattack.[^08chapter8_33]

Using the files of individuals, communities and national populations
offers potentials for breakthroughs in medical research. It also offers
investors potential rewards that dwarf those reaped by figures such as
Bill Gates, George Soros, Mark Zuckerberg and Larry Ellison.

We are thus seeing disputes about claims to own genes, most prominently
in litigation about molecular diagnostic patents gained by Myriad
Genetics Inc. regarding breast cancer diagnosis. Those disputes follow
litigation regarding the highly lucrative exploitation of body samples
from people such as Henrietta Lacks.[^08chapter8_34] They pose questions about
privacy,[^08chapter8_35] ethics,[^08chapter8_36] trade secrets,[^08chapter8_37] treating data as
property,[^08chapter8_38] and about the appropriateness of exclusive ownership of
genomic data that is not unique to a particular individual but is
instead common to that person's siblings.[^08chapter8_39] They involve conundrums
about the balance between public benefit and the private interests of
people who have knowingly or otherwise shared their genomic data, not
necessarily addressed through promises regarding de-identification to
make data good.[^08chapter8_40] The effectiveness of de-identification mechanisms
remains contentious, [^08chapter8_41] given the scope for associating
individual/familial genomic data with other identifiers in the public
and private realms -- a manifestation of the 'big data' explored
elsewhere in this book. The disputes require thought about incentives
for innovation and about regulatory incapacity in a global economy where
data may be readily harvested in one jurisdiction, analyzed in another
jurisdiction and used or misused in other jurisdictions. They require
thought about the balance between public and private goods, with an
absolute de-identification for example vitiating much research.

As such they encourage thought about the nature of 'good data', explored
in the following part of this chapter, and what might be done to
minimize harms without forgoing the advancement of research in the
life-sciences or disregarding perceptions that data gathered through the
public health system is one of the few major assets that might be
privatized by neoliberal governments in an era of budget stringency.

## Goodness

The goodness of data is a founding value of modernity.[^08chapter8_42] Data
legitimizes public policy in the contemporary liberal democratic state.
Data is perceived as freeing us from superstition and alleviating fear
of what is unknown or misunderstood. Data is a matter of disenchantment,
truth rather than fantasy. It enables bureaucratic rationality that is a
marker of efficient public administration and commerce. Data allows a
coherent evaluation of the past, management of the present and
prediction of the future. Data is a prerequisite of fact-based medicine
and public health initiatives, evident in for example disquiet about
homeopathy and much 'new age' therapy. Data's perceived innate goodness
is implicit in catchphrases such as 'the facts speak for themselves',
'statistics show', 'facts are power', 'the facts, just the facts' and
'the evidence proves'. It is implicit in the primacy of national
statistical agencies (and the mandatory status of much census activity),
the culture of risk-management on the basis of population-scale data
resources that influence the provision of financial services,[^08chapter8_43] and
the valorization of epidemiological studies since at least the time of
John Snow's mapping of cholera in Georgian London.[^08chapter8_44]

Reality is, of course, somewhat more complicated. Rob Kitchin, in
referring to a 'knowledge pyramid', contextualized 'data' by commenting
that 'data precedes information, which precedes knowledge, which
precedes understanding and wisdom'.[^08chapter8_45] In considering what genomic
'good data' is through a lens of community benefit and individual
dignity, we might accordingly conceptualize data as a tool, rather than
an outcome. On that basis goodness might be assessed through reference
to how the tool is devised and used rather than merely whether the
products of its use -- the understanding, diagnostics, therapies and
revenue -- are beneficent.

If we look beyond the 'data is good' rhetoric noted above we might for
example recognize that some data collection is egregiously wrong,
fundamentally tainting knowledge that results from the tool. Provenance
matters. We might also recognize that although the tool was devised with
care for human dignity and used without any intention to harm some
outcomes of its use may be subjectively or objectively bad. Recognition
acknowledges differentials in who gets to collect data, who defines
data, who analyses data, who acts upon it and who disseminates (or
chooses not to disseminate) data.

Good data is thus more than a matter of accuracy, an accuracy that is
often reflective of care to identify and thence reduce error in data
collection and analysis. Accuracy may be a function of the scale of data
collection, with a survey of a large number of people for example
producing data that is 'good' because it is representative rather than
being skewed to a specific cohort. That emphasis on comprehensiveness
has driven the large-scale genomic initiatives discussed later in this
chapter, with researchers and investors aspiring to population-scale
mapping of the human genome and health.

'Goodness' might also be construed in terms of efficiency, with data
collection being assessed in terms of the cost of data
collection/analysis and more broadly in terms of the knowledge that
results from the collection, knowledge that is valuable for investors or
public administrators. In the age of the neoliberal enterprise
university, where funders are wary of disinterested research, it is
axiomatic that institutions deal with data to generate financially
tangible outcomes: there is no collection for data's sake.[^08chapter8_46]

In the life sciences several data collection projects over the past
seventy years provide a framework for conceptualizing data goodness in
considering genomic initiatives.

One project, in Nazi Germany, involved the collection by medical
researchers of data about the resilience of the human body under extreme
stress, with the expectation that the resultant knowledge would enable
life-saving practices. The collection involved researchers placing
concentration camp inmates in freezing water, in high pressure chambers,
or depriving them of air. Those data objects -- people -- were not
provided with painkillers. They were not in a position to consent, and
were denied dignity.[^08chapter8_47] Many died during the data collection. The data
collected during what we now characterize in law as a crime against
humanity might have been accurate and useful but is fundamentally
tainted.[^08chapter8_48]

The same can be said for the Pernkopf anatomical atlas, a masterly
depiction of the human body and accordingly acclaimed over several
editions for its accuracy and usefulness for medical students.[^08chapter8_49] From
that perspective it is an artefact of good data. It is however a work
that draws on the bodies of concentration camp inmates, some of whom may
have been 'killed to order' for the anatomists. It prompts disquieting
questions about goodness.

We can see other egregious denials of dignity in data collection and use
closer to our own time. Recall for example, the Tuskagee Syphilis Study
in the United States, where researchers tracked the health of
communities containing residents infected with syphilis. Similar studies
involved prisoners and people in Guatemala.[^08chapter8_50] Saliently, the people
were not offered therapies, were not alerted to the nature of any
symptoms (meaning that they did not gain treatment from other
clinicians) and were in a subordinate position. National security was
invoked to justify research for the US Central Intelligence Agency into
the effects of LSD.[^08chapter8_51] Staff at the Alder Hey hospital, and other
institutions in the UK, harvested organs for research purposes without
family consent.[^08chapter8_52] Those organs are embodiments of genomic data and
potentially beneficial for teaching; the practice means however that the
data was not 'good'. US surgeons famously commodified Henrietta Lacks;
no consent was obtained from Ms Lacks or her family for culturing and
marketing of a cell line cultured from her cancer biopsy (now used in
laboratories across the globe), there was no acknowledgement and no
compensation was provided for appropriation of her genetic
material.[^08chapter8_53]

In construing the goodness of data we might accordingly be alert to
questions about whether the tool is ethical rather than merely accurate
and efficient. Does it for example respect dignity? Is the knowledge
that results from the data fair?

## 'Good' Data, Bad Practice?

Those questions underpin a consideration of contemporary genomic
initiatives, particularly those that are marketed as 'recreational
genomics', and gene patents such as those held by Myriad Inc. More
broadly they underpin thought about population-scale health data
initiatives such as the UK care.data program that, as discussed below,
encountered fundamental difficulties because bureaucratic indifference
to consent eroded its perceived legitimacy.[^08chapter8_54] Data in public and
private collections, for research or other purposes, may be good because
accurate but was its generation respectful and is its use fair? In
essence, 'goodness' as a matter of legitimacy may be a function of
provenance rather than accuracy.

Excitement over the wonders of genomics, evident in characterisations
such as reading 'the book of life', and fundamental reductions in the
cost of genomic data processing have resulted in the emergence of
recreational genomics. Put simply, consumers provide a genomic service
such as 23andMe and Ancestry.com with a body sample, typically in the
form of a painless swab from the mouth. That provision might be as a
gift, with the consumer neither paying a fee nor receiving a payment. It
might instead be on a consumer pays fee for service basis. In return,
consumers receive reports that relate them to contemporary/historic
cohorts (for example under the Genographic Project indicate that x
percent of your ancestors were Vikings or came from Africa) or point to
specific genetic traits, such as a dislike of certain vegetables, or
phenotypic (physical) phenomena.[^08chapter8_55] The data that appears in those
reports is the property of the service provider.

The marketing of those services has emphasized recreation, for example
as part of a genealogical hobby, rather than therapy. They appeal to
novelty and a popular desire for social connectedness. Although they use
the language of science and rely on popular faith in the liberating
effects of medical data they are typically situated outside health
regulation frameworks. They do not require prescription or guidance by a
clinician. They might be dourly viewed as akin to genomic fortune
telling: an entertainment service that is correspondingly weakly
regulated because outside the health realm.[^08chapter8_56]

Recreational genomics poses several issues. Consumers and some
regulators may not appreciate the implications of the data that can
emerge from the sequencing. From the perspective of privacy scholars the
initiatives are problematic because individuals are not genetically
unique. Some of our genes are common to biological relatives, especially
siblings. Inferences of varying accuracy can be drawn about the genomic
characteristics of close and distant relatives. If we conceptualize a
person as a genomic file, an embodiment of genomic data, we can see that
participants in recreational genomics are unilaterally offering service
providers data about other people rather than just about themselves.
Some people with concerns about potential genetic discrimination -- the
genomic redlining by insurers, employers and others that has featured in
legal literature over the past twenty years -- may choose not to
participate in recreational genomics and be disquieted that others are
tacitly co-opting them through undisclosed provision of swabs.[^08chapter8_57] The
authors of this chapter have highlighted concerns about a 'right not to
know' (freedom from an unwanted disclosure within a family circle of a
health condition identified in a genomic report gained by a
relative),[^08chapter8_58] and about the accuracy of reports from service providers
and their potential misinterpretation by consumers.[^08chapter8_59]

Those concerns co-exist with weakness of national and international
regulation of the services, which typically operate globally and are
inadequately constrained by national privacy law that is often based on
the principle that protections are waived if consumers consent to data
collection, processing and sharing. Genomic data collection for
aggregation and sale is likely to be the unstated or even express
business model of recreational genomic services, given the value of
large-scale genomic and other health repositories. That value was a
driver of the contentious UK care.data initiative, with the British
government proposing to sell several decades of National Health Service
records (i.e. from hospitals and general practitioners) about all
English patients, without patient consent on the basis that the data
would be de-identified.[^08chapter8_60]

It is arguable that there is insufficiently informed consent on the part
of many recreational genomics consumers, who are unaware of (or
indifferent to) whether the data they provide is being sold to or
otherwise shared with third parties such as pharmaceutical
companies.[^08chapter8_61] Some presumably trust that the services will rigorously
protect what in time will amount to global genomic databases that, like
financial databases, are susceptible to unauthorized disclosure by
insiders and hacking by outsiders. Few consumers will have much sense of
the scope for law enforcement and national security agencies to override
the often vague undertakings made by the services and access the data
without disclosure to the affected individuals.

Services conceptualize genomic data as property, an asset that can be
bounded by confidentiality and employment law and that can be assigned a
value for sale or security. Entities outside the recreational genomics
sector have also conceptualized genomic data in terms of exclusive
rights that enable a substantial return on investment. A salient example
is Myriad Inc., a United States corporation that has aggressively sought
and asserted patent rights regarding the BRCA 1 gene, associated with
breast cancer.[^08chapter8_62] The prevalence of breast cancer, the morbidity of
its occurrence and perceptions that life-threatening illness can be
predicted for pre-emptive surgery or other therapy means that Myriad's
patents are commercially very valuable. Unsurprisingly, Myriad has
sought to exploit what is often misreported as 'ownership' of genes or
more accurately as a tool with some diagnostic value, resulting in
criticism across the globe that its pricing and asserted monopoly
exclude the disadvantaged. Analysts have questioned whether gene patents
as such should be recognized in law, either on grounds of public policy
or because they involve discovery rather than invention. Others argue
that much of the data at the heart of gene patents was gained through
publicly-funded research, so any patent revenue should be shared with
the state.

## A Genomic Commons?

One response to propertization of genomic data (i.e. characterising it
as something over which a discoverer, collector or aggregator has
exclusive rights that are legally enforceable and that can be
commodified through sale, licence or gift) is to treat the human genome
as a commons, something that is properly considered as requiring a
public understanding that extends beyond debates about potential
commodification of resources on the basis of exclusive rights.[^08chapter8_63]

Recognition of the genome as something that is a global resource that
must be both socially understood and curated rather than strip-mined on
an opportunistic basis will strike some readers as legally or
politically naive. It would require change to national law and
interpretation of international intellectual property agreements. It
would not chill discovery, consistent with a history of research that
was funded by government and philanthropic institutions that valorised
the common good through an emphasis on what would now be characterized
as 'open data', i.e. publication in readily accessible journals. (Such
publication would prevent much patent activity, given that the
'invention' to be protected would not be novel.)

A commons would not resolve conundrums regarding genomic privacy. A
solution to those conundrums lies outside patent law.

## Genomics and Data in a Good Society

Infolibertarian John Perry Barlow envisaged that in the imminent age of
data -- bits and bytes -- the state would wither because neither
relevant nor effective, with what he construed as the individualistic
values underlying the US Constitution becoming universal. [^08chapter8_64]
Regulation, seen as innately restrictive of creativity and thus of
individual goods, would cease to be viable in a digital world without
borders, a market integrated by the internet rather than by state
agreements such as the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property (TRIPS). Nicholas Negroponte more vividly pictured
the irrelevant state evaporating like a mothball.[^08chapter8_65] A succinct
response was provided by Bart Kosko: 'we'll have governments as long as
we have atoms to protect'.[^08chapter8_66] The past two decades have shown that the
lions are reluctant to lie down with the lambs. National borders (and
national interests) remain powerful. The law of man -- as distinct from
Barlow and Lessig's law of code -- continues to shape both investment
and consumption.[^08chapter8_67] In thinking about good data we need to think about
the good society, one that John Rawls would consider to be fair,[^08chapter8_68]
and that Martha Nussbaum would endorse as fostering the capabilities of
all members of the state.[^08chapter8_69] Good data from that perspective is data
and practice that underpins the good society. It is not solely or
primarily a matter of property and of law regarding property.

It is unlikely that we will see an international reworking of
international intellectual property law to specifically exclude the
genome from patent protection. An inability to achieve such a reworking
reflects the difficulties evident in global trade negotiations over the
past five decades, with the slowing of economic growth and the
mercantilism evident in statements by US President Trump, for example,
exacerbating the recalcitrance of key actors about surrendering what
they see as national advantages. Leading corporations appear unlikely to
relinquish what they perceive as key competitive advantages in terms of
exploiting genomic information, with public policymakers being
influenced by a genomic data version of the axiom that what's good for
General Motors is good for the US.

There is perhaps more hope at the national level, especially in response
to egregious rent-seeking of the type highlighted by Martin
Shkreli.[^08chapter8_70] In the age of big data states remain relevant because they
permit private actors to exercise power (something that is not
inherently bad) and have scope to intervene through a range of policy
levers when those actors fail to exhibit adequate internal restraints.
Liberal democratic states have tended to acknowledge private property
rights and offset market inefficiencies by respecting patents but
subsidising the price of key pharmaceuticals for consumers. In essence,
the taxpayer fills the gap so that disadvantaged consumers can flourish,
and trade sanctions will not be instituted. We might act more boldly.

Such action would recognise genomic patents, such as those gained by
Myriad, but cap the prices charged for products embodying those patents
and attributable to genomic data. That restriction can be deemed as
legitimate both in terms of rationales for intellectual property
protection -- patents are not an end in themselves -- and because much
genomic research is founded on discovery in the public domain by public
institutions or funded by public agencies.

Lawyers and legal academics typically conceptualize problems and
solutions in terms of law, with data, for example, being addressed in
terms of jurisprudence regarding copyright, evidence, employment,
computer and confidentiality law. Conceptualising good data in relation
to a good society requires an acknowledgement that there is scope for
regulation outside international agreements, national statutes and
judgments. The preceding paragraphs imply that we might look to the
behaviour of clinicians and researchers, bounded at an individual and
institutional level by ethical codes regarding the exploitation of human
subjects, the oversight of research (which often has an institutional or
cross-institutional basis) and the allocation of funding. Can
researchers refuse to partner with corporations deemed to be unduly
exploitative, a refusal that is likely to be career limiting? Can
research institutions more easily refuse to licence to those
corporations or, despite government pressure to be self-sustaining
through an aggressive patent-building strategy, emphasise placing
genomic research in the public domain. Is 'Good Data' that which is
available to all, across borders and without the tyranny of the
quarterly return?

A contention in this chapter is that dignity is inextricably associated
with agency, at its simplest the ability to make decisions, enjoy
benefits (individual or social) and take responsibility. The genomic
initiatives critiqued above typically deny agency.

That denial is a matter of obfuscation where providers of genetic
material, for example participants in recreational genomics projects
such as 23andMe, are not equipped with the information they need to make
informed choices about the consequences for themselves and relatives of
that participation. Respect for the capacity of consumers to make
decisions, including what we might construe as foolish decisions, should
be reflected in both fuller disclosure as part of the initiatives and
more broadly by a public education program that informs people about
public policy issues rather than merely about the wonders of gene
sequencing and the likelihood of achieving fundamental medical
breakthroughs from large-scale data capture. Education might reduce some
privacy harms by alerting people of the potential consequences of
unilaterally providing data about close/distant relatives, particularly
if law changed to inhibit genomic discrimination.[^08chapter8_71]

Measures to foster that public understanding of what is 'good' data and
good data practice would importantly serve to inform community debate
about initiatives where people have been denied agency by having no
choice about whether their data is mandatorily conscripted for national
health databases such as Care. Data or by having little real choice
because use of 'opt out' mechanisms is designed to be unduly onerous.

## Conclusion

This chapter began by referring to pre-genomic conceptions of what is
good, with Kant for example addressing Aristotle's questions about 'the
good' by exhorting us not to treat people as a means to an end,
abstractions without dignity that can be sacrificed for personal,
institutional or political needs. In an era where investors, governments
and researchers are awed by 'big data' -- the bigger the better -- it is
useful to recall statements such as Stalin's 'the death of one person is
a tragedy, the death of a million is a mere statistic' and the
fetishization of bigness in Mao's China where the demise of millions was
an acceptable price to pay for an industrial leap forward.[^08chapter8_72]

The collection, study and exploitation of genomic data does not have to
be dystopian. Bigness is not inherently bad; nor is profit. A contention
running through this chapter is that the 'goodness' of genomic data is a
function of respect for human dignity, something that requires thinking
beyond specific data collection mechanisms and applications.

Good genomic data is not a matter of bulk and breadth: the number of
data subjects and their representativeness of a national or global
population. It is not a matter of good title: recognized property rights
under patent or other law. It is instead more usefully conceived in
terms of a mindset, a response to questions that are best addressed
through an ethic of responsibility rather than ownership.[^08chapter8_73] As we
increasingly make sense of the book of life we might accordingly choose
to exercise our own agency, and the agency of the governments that are
accountable to us, and conceptualize good data as a matter of curation
for the common good rather than property in which a fortunate few have
exclusive rights. The potential agency of government has been
disregarded or dismissed by proponents of neoliberalism, i.e. an
ideology in which the invisible hand of the market solves all policy
questions. In considering genomic data we suggest that agency may be
construed in terms of intellectual property and other legal frameworks
at both global and national levels, alongside state-sanctioned
professional codes and decision-making by government funders of genomic
research. Agency may also be construed in terms of action by public
sector entities, a matter of formal authority to intervene in markets,
of expertise to both understand and articulate questions about genomic
data, and a culture in which regulators are willing to intervene. That
intervention -- what might be characterized as a reintroduction of state
-- should provide legitimacy for the state (a social good) and foster
understanding by individuals about how we collectively and individually
manage the genome. An ultimate function of the state is enabling
discourse about what is good.
