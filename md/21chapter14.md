# 14: Data for the Social Good: Toward a Data-Activist Research Agenda

Becky Kazansky, Guillén Torres, Lonneke van der Velden, Kersti
Wissenbach and Stefania Milan[^14chapter14_1]

**Introduction**

'Big data' is a hyped buzzword---or rather, it has been for a while,
before being supplanted by 'newer' acclaimed concepts such as artificial
intelligence. The popularity of the term says something about the
widespread fascination with the seemingly infinite possibilities of
automatized data collection and analysis. This enchantment affects not
only the corporate sector, where many technology companies have centered
their business model on data mining, and governments, whose intelligence
agencies have adopted sophisticated machinery to monitor citizens. Many
civic society organizations, too, are increasingly trying to take
advantage of the opportunities brought about by datafication, using data
to improve society. From crowdsourced maps about gender-based violence
('feminicide') in Latin America, to the analysis of audio-visual footage
to map drone attacks in conflict zones, individuals and groups regularly
produce, collect, process and repurpose data to fuel research for the
social good. Problematizing the mainstream connotations of big data,
these examples of 'data activism' take a critical stance towards massive
data collection and represent the new frontier of citizens' engagement
with information and technological innovation.

In this chapter we survey diverse experiences and methodologies of what
we call 'data-activist research'---an approach to research that combines
embeddedness in the social world with the research methods typical of
academia and the innovative repertoires of data activists. We argue that
such approach to knowledge production fosters community building and
knowledge sharing, while providing a way to fruitfully interrogate
datafication and democratic participation. By exploring what we can
learn from data-activist projects and investigating the conditions for
collaboration between activist communities and academia, we aim at
laying the groundwork for a data-activist research agenda whose dynamics
are socially responsible and empowering for all the parties involved.

The chapter is organized as follows. We begin offering a working
definition of data-activist research. We explain how the notion has
developed within the DATACTIVE research collective at the University of
Amsterdam, whose work investigates the politics of datafication and
massive data collection from the perspective of civil society. We
describe how our commitment to 'engaged research' feeds into our ideas
about data-activist research.[^14chapter14_2] We build upon interdisciplinary
literature on datafication and the valuable insights shared by
activists, civil society organizations and engaged researchers at the
*Data for the Social Good* workshop (University of Amsterdam, November
2017).[^14chapter14_3] We discuss concrete examples of existing research projects
and their novel tools and approaches. Since our main goal is to call for
more interaction between activists and academics, we conclude with a
reflection on the ethics of collaboration, as we deem these two elements
to be central questions today. We hope that this discussion will
encourage the two communities to appropriate and build upon the powerful
approach of data-activist research.

## Defining Data-activist Research

The label data-activist research emerges at the intersection of
'traditional' research and the set of critical and/or activist practices
that deal or 'act upon' datafication.[^14chapter14_4] The roots of data-activist
research are to be found in data activism itself, which critically
engages with the manifold impact of datafication on social life.[^14chapter14_5]
Processes of turning aspects of social life into data are of course not
new and have always been at the core of the practices of science and
knowledge production.[^14chapter14_6] Nor are efforts to challenge how social life
is turned into data a new thing. For example, where statistics have long
been used to steer city and health planning, official numbers and
calculations have been challenged by 'statactivists' to produce
impactful public policy reform.[^14chapter14_7] However, over the last decade,
datafication has become a fundamental component of people's lived
reality and a major driver of knowledge production. Whether it is
through social media use, engaging with the government, buying online
goods, or using public transport, people are continuously digitally
'measured', included in databases,[^14chapter14_8] and interact with such
measurements through the feedback they get via apps and other
devices.[^14chapter14_9] Furthermore, these data are afterwards used in various
types of knowledge production activities that feed political and
economic decision-making and governance processes.

The specific way in which civil society actors have responded to the new
possibilities and risks brought about by datafication has informed our
research into data activism, an umbrella term which embraces, for
instance, socio-technical practices that provide counter-hegemonic
responses to the discrimination, social exclusion and privacy
infringement that go hand in hand with big data.[^14chapter14_10] Data activism
'interrogates the politics of big data',[^14chapter14_11] and it does so in a
variety of ways: for instance, '\[t\]he action repertoire of data
activists includes examining, manipulating, leveraging, and exploiting
data, along with resisting and meddling in their creation and use'.[^14chapter14_12]
In other words, data activism includes both the use, mobilization or
creation of datasets for social causes (providing an alternative to what
big data corporations or state agencies do with data), as well as the
development and employment of technologies that frustrate massive data
collection (providing protection to what big data corporations or state
agencies do with data).[^14chapter14_13]

Studying the methods and strategies of data activism led us to question
our own *research processes, practices and relationships*. This is
because data activism signals the emergence of innovative 'epistemic
cultures',[^14chapter14_14] namely experimental and context-specific ways of
producing knowledge about and with data. As Milan and van der Velden
suggested, by '\[p\]ostulating a critical/active engagement with data,
its forms, dynamics, and infrastructure, data activists function as
producers of counter-expertise and alternative epistemologies, making
sense of data as a way of knowing the world and turning it into a point
of intervention'.[^14chapter14_15] Take for instance the artist Mimi Onuoha, who
created a 'Library of Missing Datasets' to strategically draw attention
to important issues of social justice which could benefit from more
data,[^14chapter14_16] or the experience of the activists using drones to counter
decades of injustice over oil exploitation in the Amazon
rainforest.[^14chapter14_17] These cases signal that (data) activism is a powerful
location for knowledge production able to fuel political projects,
through practices that draw from institutionally entrenched approaches
to research while simultaneously subverting, expanding and questioning
their components.

It is in collaboration with these novel epistemic cultures that we see
possibilities for constructive interaction between activism and
academia, and for a joint discussion about what 'data activist research
for the social good' could look like. This entails not only a reflection
*about* data activism that tries to locate its most innovative and
empowering research practices, but also entails paying attention to what
engaged and productive role academia could play in the process. In other
words, can we do data-activist research ourselves, and if so, how? What
could academia learn from these emerging practices and what could it
offer back? What are the conditions of possibility for joint research
projects? We argue that to provide the best answer to these questions it
is necessary to move beyond doing research *about* (data) activism,
towards conducting institutional boundary-crossing research that finds
common grounds and opportunities for collaboration *with* (data)
activists.[^14chapter14_18] In the next section we further explore this claim.

## Data-activist Research is Engaged Research

Several members of the DATACTIVE research group have known or have been
involved for long with the communities they study. They have faced an
important question that arises when researching groups one is closely
affiliated with: how to develop and deploy a research pathway that is
most relevant for the community, making sure that the community itself
can contribute to shape both the project's goals and practices? In other
words, how can we do research that matters also to those being
researched? These concerns are certainly not new in academia, and there
are several examples of individuals and groups who approached research
*in a different way*. Early attempts at co-producing knowledge while
reflecting upon its connection to community empowerment can be found in
the 1960s and 1970s. They were influenced by the writings of Brazilian
educator Paolo Freire and the *con-ricerca* (co-inquiry) experiments in
Italy, for example involving factory workers in analyzing the social
impact of capitalism.[^14chapter14_19] Since the 1980s, Charlotte Ryan, co-director
of the now dormant Movement/Media Research Action Project (MRAP) at
Boston College (US), has been experimenting with producing recursive
'two-way, dialogic exchanges that create new, generalizable knowledge'
expected to contribute to the 'democratization of theorizing'.[^14chapter14_20]
Because both theorizing and practice benefit if scholars 'embed
themselves in movements, not simply as active citizens but as skilled
learners',[^14chapter14_21] MRAP members encouraged activists and scholars to
establish 'learning communities; based on shared learning practices and
work routines. More recently, Lovink and Rossiter have pointed to the
importance of working together with actors in the field, since
'collaborative concept production' is needed in order to keep theory up
to date.[^14chapter14_22] Similarly, the *DataCenter: Research for Justice*
organization in Oakland, California, have characterized its Research
Justice Model as having three main tenets:

> 1\) It defines research processes as a collective endeavor and a shared
> knowledge creation process between and academic and community
> researchers;
>
> \(2) It creates, maintains, and engages with the knowledge that is
> produced by community experts, traditional knowledge keepers, as well as
> cultural leaders in ways that envision research as a ceremonial act of
> mutual respect and co-sharing; and
>
> \(3) Only research that is responsive to the social, legal, economic
> cultural, and political policy needs as identified by community experts
> should be conducted.[^14chapter14_23]

Drawing from these sources of inspiration, DATACTIVE proposes an
'engaged' approach to research that questions the impact that empirical
inquiry has over people and communities, and strives to contribute to
their causes.[^14chapter14_24] Such an approach entails to do research 'with\'
instead of merely 'about', thus entering into a continuous dialogue with
the fields of action and interaction being observed.[^14chapter14_25] Nevertheless,
an engaged approach to research does not lose sight of the wider context
and maintains a sharp attention to the question of power.

In our view, data-activist research should thus emerge as the result of
community endeavors whose perspectives and self-definitions can be
located in specific and contested discourses about technology,
information, activism, marginalization, exclusion and even selfhood,
rather than being merely the result of the interaction between
disembodied agents in a universal field of knowledge. In what follows we
present four case studies that give a sense of what data-activist
research might mean in practice.

## Data-activist Research in Practice

*Forensic Oceanography*, *The Syrian Archive*, and the local instances
of the *Alaveteli* software are good examples of data-activist research
which succeed at performing a series of steps allowing
activist-researchers to do 'research that matters'. The three projects
managed to remain close to the problems they identified, to then take a
step back to develop an abstract understanding and analysis of the
reality, only to return to the field to address the community issues
that had been identified. As we will see, what these projects
demonstrate is that research processes are more productive when they are
meaningful to specific communities rather than merely a product of
'disembodied scientific objectivity'.[^14chapter14_26]

### Forensic Oceanography: In search of a 'disobedient gaze'

*Forensic Oceanography* is the maritime counterpart of *Forensic
Architecture* focusing specifically on migration and bordering.
*Forensic Architecture* started in 2011 as an ERC-funded research
project at Goldsmiths, University of London (UK), to turn later into a
stand-alone research agency focused on the production of evidence of
human rights violations. Through the analysis of architecture, the
environment, and its media representations, researchers have provided
prosecution teams, political organizations and international
institutions alike with evidence that can be used in court. The research
agency has engaged in a variety of projects spanning from the analysis
of deadly drone attacks in Syria, to the disappearance of 43 Mexican
students, to the ecocide in Indonesia.[^14chapter14_27] The data sources that
Forensic Architecture relies upon to fuel its investigation are of
varied nature---from satellite images, to publicly available data and
media produced by the communities involved in the events under scrutiny.

The 'Left to Die Boat', a project by *Forensic Oceanography,* is a good
example of the work of *Forensic Architecture*: it reconstructs the
story of a vessel that left Libya with 72 people on-board in the midst
of the NATO-led military intervention in the country. The boat ran out
of fuel, drifted for two weeks and was finally washed back to the Libyan
coast. Most of its passengers died. The survivors stated that they had
contact with several ships and helicopters, but no one intervened to
help. Using publicly available databases on sea traffic, the researchers
traced and visualized the contacts made by the boat, proving that a
number of ships, including military vessels, were indeed navigating
close by, but chose not to intervene. The evidence allowed advocates to
start a number of legal petitions against NATO member states, accused of
the crime of non-assistance at sea.[^14chapter14_28]

*Forensic Oceanography* shows how it is possible to use as research
input monitoring technologies, including those typically used by police
forces, with the goal of bringing about a 'disobedient gaze'---a
perspective that challenges the dominant narrative. As Pezzani and
Heller explain it, this disobedient gaze performs a reversal of the
surveilling action, turning its sight to the act of policing
itself.[^14chapter14_29] Through this inversion, *Forensic Oceanography* brings to
light events and issues that the surveilling system prefers to hide. It
also shows how monitoring technologies can be used to hold accountable
the very agents who set them in place to exert power. Thus, this
project---as well as the rest of *Forensic Architecture*'s work---makes
evident how the availability of data can foster the creation of new
mechanisms of participation that take advantage of technologies designed
for other purposes. In this sense, *Forensic Oceanography* is a great
example of the diverse politics of datafication, since the data produced
by surveilling technologies can also be processed to provide backing
evidence to strengthen the politicization of contemporary social issues.

Departing from *Forensic Oceanography*'s work, it could be interesting
for data-activist research to think about what other kinds of
'disobedient data politics' are possible,[^14chapter14_30] and what their ethical
implications are. For example, given that many of the technologies used
by *Forensic Oceanography* have been designed with the goal of
performing surveillance, it is important to remain attentive to the
question of whether there are risks in using them. If data-activist
research engages with scraping, data monitoring, etc., how can
activist-researchers engage in these activities in a responsible way
that does not reproduce the extractive and exploitative rationality of
the mainstream discourse and practices? What we learn from this type of
projects is that researchers and the communities they work with benefit
from 'continuously reflecting upon whether their investigation
contributes to a "disobedient gaze", rather than merely a vigilant
one.'[^14chapter14_31]

## The Syrian Archive: Turning Open Source Intelligence Upside-down

The *Syrian Archive* is an Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) effort to
document and preserve information about human rights violations
committed by all sides of the Syrian conflict.[^14chapter14_32] Started in 2014, the
project brings together developers and human rights activists focusing
on the preservation of media evidence under threat of being deleted or
censored from the online platforms where it is uploaded. Its main goals
are to secure data, verify its authenticity, and categorize it. The
resulting database allows the wider public to reuse the material for
various purposes, although evidence gathering concerning human rights
violations is the primary rationale.

The *Syrian Archive* aims at implementing ethical principles starting
from the design of the technology that powers its activities, the
methodologies, and the way its activist-researchers preserve findings.
The tools built in the context of the project are open source and most
of the code used to process and organize the data is made available in
the software repository GitHub. The project also follows a user-centered
approach maintaining regular contact with media sources, who have
provided so far more than 1 million entries to the archive, all of which
have undergone verification and categorization. The project's ultimate
goals are to identify reliable sources of data collection, organize the
material in a database, establish the trustworthiness of the content,
and automatizing data collection and preservation.

The *Syrian Archive*'s methodology makes evident that even working with
publicly available data has severe ethical implications. For example,
one of the many thorny issues its activist-researchers constantly
reflect upon is how to acquire the consent of those depicted in the
footage, or how to decide what should be preserved and what should be
discarded. To guide decisions, the project follows a 'do no harm'
approach,[^14chapter14_33] taking care to exclude certain sensitive data. 'Do no
harm' refers to a set of protocols intended to make sure that
humanitarian practitioners do not end up further harming the situation
they intend to improve.[^14chapter14_34] Additionally, for the *Syrian Archive*,
'open source' does not only refer to the public availability of its
materials, but also a specific approach to the transparency of protocols
and practices. Keeping the software tools open allows other activists to
replicate the work of the organization.

In conclusion, the activities of the *Syrian Archive* stress that, even
if one purses an urgent goal through activism---such as collecting data
about human rights violations before it disappears or gets censored---it
is still of paramount importance to pay attention to the consequences of
data gathering, processing and sharing facilitated by digital
technology. Furthermore, the project shows how it is possible to build
databases with a rationality that does not aim at maximizing control or
private benefit, but focuses on its political potential.

## Alaveteli: Engaging with communities across borders

*Alaveteli* identifies a Freedom of Information (FOI) request platform
and the community that emerged around it. It is currently implemented in
25 countries across the world.[^14chapter14_35] The original platform was launched
in 2008 in the UK under the name 'What do They Know'. The open source
code of the platform, however, was quickly picked up by other civil
society actors (the first in New Zealand), before the
e-democracy project
*mySociety* made its own iteration available for everyone under the name
*Alaveteli*, offering support for groups who were interested in adopting
it locally. *Alaveteli* enables citizens to openly request information
from government institutions, allowing the whole process to be tracked
online and the institutional replies to be available for everyone. In
each local deployment, the success or failure of advocating for FOI and
engaging civil society through the platform depends on a multitude of
factors, such as cultural dynamics, political restrictions, and
infrastructural limitations. For example, the backgrounds of the actors
who have picked up the code locally are very diverse, ranging from
political activists to journalists, from technologists to human rights
organizations. The responses to context-related challenges are therefore
also varied. While some platform implementations are deeply rooted in an
activist ethos, with people spending significant proportion of their
volunteer time into platform management and mobilization, other
*Alaveteli* communities have been more efficient in pursuing social
innovation grants to localize the platform and engage in
awareness-raising. The long-term success of the platform usually depends
on the ability of the actors involved to establish wider collaborations.
For instance, if a group of techies has set up the platform,
collaborations with advocacy groups help to create awareness, increase
engagement and establish links with potential users such as journalists.

Cycling back to our original quest for 'good' collaborations between
researchers and the communities on the ground, *Alaveteli* well
exemplifies the crucial role of human interaction and
relationship-building around technological innovation if this is to
become relevant for local communities. The platform's reliance on the
local context and its specificities underscores also the importance of
making use of the already existing infrastructure---encompassing both
technology and human relations---and building on the previous experience
of local activists. In sum, data-activist research requires paying
attention not only to infrastructure practices, but also to local
contexts and human dynamics.

## One from the house: Studying collaboration in online communities

The DATACTIVE research group has contributed to the development of a
computational research tool called *BigBang*, 'a toolkit for studying
communications data from collaborative projects'.[^14chapter14_36] Our interest in
*BigBang* grew out of the desire to understand how the human rights
discourse has evolved within multi-stakeholder discussions about the
governance of international data flows. Thus far, this research has
targeted a number of community mailing lists within the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).[^14chapter14_37]

Among other functionalities, *BigBang* allows researchers to scrape
large swaths of data from a mailing list database and easily search for
keywords. *BigBang* has proven especially useful to the study of ICANN
because the large majority of community interactions takes place on
mailing lists. As a large community with thousands of contributors
across the globe, ICANN produces many data traces. This amount of data
can prove cumbersome for manual analysis, hence automating the search
for keywords makes the task of investigating the discursive evolution in
internet governance processes more manageable. However, the toolkit
brings up some concerns because it facilitates research techniques in
the realm of 'big data' analysis---a set of techniques which the
DATACTIVE project investigates with a critical eye. Partaking in the
development and use of this tool presents an interesting opportunity for
us to reflect on our research ethics, the 'why' of our research, and our
connection with the issues at stake.

Take for example the distinct understandings and expectations of privacy
in different community-contexts---a question which is relevant to most
data-activist research projects given their reliance on publicly
available data. During DATACTIVE's internal discussions we have raised
concerns about the expectations of privacy that can be found in
different online contexts, and asked how these expectations are affected
when the data can be more easily collected and analyzed by third
parties---as *BigBang* makes possible. ICANN is a community which
conducts much of its work 'in the open'---a fundamental requisite of its
multi-stakeholder nature. Because of the open nature of the data the
organization produces, DATACTIVE felt it was ethically sound to use it
after producing a list of conditions guiding its acceptable use. These
conditions are the result of questioning our goals and intentions: why
do we harvest these data? Do we need it to achieve the goals of our
research? Who is affected by our data collection and analysis, and how?
Who benefits from our research? Among others, we learnt that when it
comes to online content the level and the modalities of publicity,
including academic publications, need to be determined on a case by case
basis and in collaboration with the participant communities themselves.

Inspired by these examples and acknowledging that data activism, in its
many forms, emerges from a plurality of social worlds and
identities,[^14chapter14_38] we deem crucial to reflect upon issues of
collaboration. We now turn our attention to this aspect, in order to
contribute to sketch the groundwork for a joint research agenda between
data activists and academics.

## What Collaborations for Data-Activist Research?

Reflecting on the politics of collaboration must be seen as a central
methodological task when dealing with the production and use of data to
fuel political projects in the interest of society at large. Such
reflection has to be guided by the recognition of the existing
difference in organizational cultures, modus operandi, goals and values
that characterize activists on the one hand, and researchers on the
others.[^14chapter14_39] Collaborative data-activist research strategies can benefit
from researchers and communities developing questions and research
practices jointly from the start, remaining open for the exchange of
different types of know-how despite the apparent difference in
expertise.[^14chapter14_40] Such approach aims to go beyond the 'distant reading' of
the data points activists produce, moving instead towards a 'critical
proximity' that remains close to the issues approached, participating in
their development.[^14chapter14_41]

The *researching with* that we highlighted as a crucial feature of
data-activist research can benefit from the process of building a 'we';
a shared identity resulting from a set of iterative activities,
dialogues and reflections connected to fundamental questions such as how
do we, as a community, define what the issue at stake is? How do we
identify mechanisms to address it? What core values guide us in the
process?[^14chapter14_42] From this perspective research is a social process that
demands a careful consideration of 'for whom' and 'to what end' it is
conducted.[^14chapter14_43]

*How, then, do we enable collaborative data activist research?* This
question addresses how the relations between, and the engagement of
researchers, activists, and wider civil society look like.[^14chapter14_44]
Charlotte Ryan has highlighted the importance of working in cycles of
dialogue rather than a one-off exchange, continuously assessing the
meaningfulness of one's research and the conditions of inequality
between researchers and activist/communities.[^14chapter14_45] As we have mentioned
before, a collaborative, dialogue-based data-activist research
methodology that fosters the process of community building and knowledge
sharing has to depart from a joint reflection on what knowledge and its
production mean, and what building a 'we' entails. However, no process
by itself has the ability to erase power asymmetries --imbalances can
very well occur within activist communities themselves along lines of
race, class, gender, expertise, etc. Therefore, processes of collective
research design and analysis need to take into account the power
asymmetries prevalent among the actors involved and consciously reduce
space for hierarchies. What are, then, the building blocks of an ethics
of data-activist research?

## The Ethics of Data-Activist Research

Within a data-activist research methodology, ethics should be understood
as a process rather than a mere checklist. In conceiving of it as a
process we take inspiration from the ethics guidelines by the
Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR),[^14chapter14_46] and feminist 'ethics of
care',[^14chapter14_47] which puts a caring relationship with research subjects at
centre stage. In what follows, we offer a list of potential starting
points in thinking about research ethics.

*1. Do no harm*

Data-activist research goes beyond the idea of attempting not to
negatively impact the communities involved. The guideline is to
collectively bring about a difference for such communities, aiming for a
positive impact as one of the main outcomes of the research.[^14chapter14_48]
Researchers should ask whose goals the research does or might further
serve, as well as what harms might come from having particular
experiences or vulnerabilities exposed and made public as research
findings.

*2. Setting equitable research agendas*

If we talk about data-activist research from a perspective centered on
collaboration, one key consideration comes to mind: data, where it is
meant to be produced and used in the interest of activists or the wider
civil society, has to be representative of the needs and interests of
those it means to 'support'.[^14chapter14_49] However, from a methodological
perspective, the reflection around collaboration must go beyond a focus
on representation; it builds on the idea that people are in charge of
the decision-making processes on which their very realities are
constructed.[^14chapter14_50] Also in the emerging field of data activism, in which
data forms the main currency of engagement in advocacy tactics,[^14chapter14_51]
forms of collaboration and engagement with civil society in order to
identify relevant tactics proves crucial for realizing representative
data structures.[^14chapter14_52]

*3. Re-centering perspectives pushed to the periphery*

Researchers should be critical of overly focusing on expert opinions, as
these can be used as proxies for the issue or groups being studied,
while much of the labor of knowledge production is being done
elsewhere.[^14chapter14_53] To this end, researchers should strive to look beyond
the most prominent names when 'sampling' and selecting research
subjects, and adopt a conscious strategy of seeking out expert opinions
from underrepresented populations such as women, people of color,
affected populations, and other minority groups.

*4. Transparency of research objectives (and funding)*

Researchers should disclose the aims of their projects and communicate
the 'why' of the research to those involved in any research
activities---whether an interview, ethnographic participant observation
or a joint policy advocacy project. Researchers should be clear that
theirs is not a 'view from nowhere', but a situated perspective.[^14chapter14_54]
Issues of class, race, and locality of the researchers should be
reflected upon within the research.

*5. Recognizing research as labor*

Researchers should understand that interacting with researchers and
'being researched' is a form of labor.[^14chapter14_55] Sitting in for interviews or
engaging in other research activities takes time away from urgent work,
including gaining an income. Thus, researchers should strive to minimize
disruptions caused by their participation in activities.[^14chapter14_56] On the
other hand, there may be instances in which researchers should also
clearly lay out expectations around their own labor of research, for
example, by explaining why it might take a certain amount of time for
findings to be 'fed back' or published.[^14chapter14_57]

*6. Contextualizing data and data collection*

Researchers should examine the context and potential consequences of
studying communities, identities, projects, networks, and dynamics. Some
data that is considered public is actually just 'publicly available
(sensitive) data.[^14chapter14_58] A minimum standard for much of social science
research is to obtain the consent of research subjects. Yet in projects
using 'big data', this can be difficult. Data-activist researchers
should thus put adequate attention to strategizing how they will
anonymize any data they use on online communities and consider if it is
ethical to collect it in the first place---and they should be up to date
with respect to data protection regulations which might prohibit its
collection.

*7. Responsible data management and sharing*

Researchers should strive to create an information management plan
prioritizing the privacy and security of research data. The development
of a plan should root itself in the particular scenarios of the research
life and should consider all phases of a research project.[^14chapter14_59] This
also includes a plan of how to store and back up research data; how to
share data with other researchers; how to transport data while traveling
across borders; how to guard data while at field sites; and how to
communicate sensitive details within the research team as well as with
research subjects.

*8. Fair attribution*

Researchers should provide correct attribution, anonymizing and
pseudonymizing as necessary, or should mention interviewees by name if
requested. This is a fundamental step in the recognition of social
actors as knowledge producers in their own right, no less than external
observers.

*9. Sharing research results*

An ethical stance forces researchers to 'share back' with their
informants. Are research subjects able to access the work they have
contributed to freely, or are publications beyond paywall? Are research
subjects able to provide feedback and discuss findings (in terms of time
and accessibility of language) before it is published? For example, our
hope within the DATACTIVE project is that researching strategies to
enhance privacy, digital security, and open source investigations in the
midst of human rights and social justice related activities can provide
useful information back to civil society actors for their own purposes.

## Conclusions and Open Issues

In this chapter we have dealt with a number of methodological and
ethical questions that need to be addressed while using and producing
data to fuel political projects in the interest of society at large.
With the help of four examples, we discussed several aspects from the
field of data activism that researchers---particularly those aiming to
work with (data) activists---could incorporate in their own work. We
have taken a brief look over matters of (disobedient) data research,
collaboration and empowerment, and data ethics. These examples have
helped us to build a series of recommendations for researchers in light
of our own interest in developing joint research projects between data
activists and academia. Much work is however needed to expand the range
of problems and solutions addressed in a data-activist fashion. Only a
broad, collaborative discussion can help us moving this agenda forward:
we thus call upon the engaged-researchers and researching-activists
across the globe to experiment and share in a long-term exercise of
re-thinking what doing 'research that matters' means in the age of
datafication.

[^14chapter14_14]: The notion of 'epistemic culture\' is used in science studies and
    refers to the 'specific strategies that generate, validate, and
    communicate scientific accomplishments'. See Karin Knorr-Cetina and
    Werner Reichmann, 'Epistemic Cultures' in *International
    Encyclopedia of the Social & Behavioral Sciences*, second edition,
    Oxford: Elsevier, 2015 pp. 873--80. The concept highlights the
    diversity in scientific practices. Here we use it to discuss the
    diversity in knowledge making in the context of datafication.
