# Chapter Fifteen: Good Data is Critical Data: An Appeal for Critical Digital Studies

Chiara Poletti and Daniel Gray

**Abstract**

In social science, approaches that call themselves critical tend to be
concerned with advancing some kind of emancipatory political cause,
often drawing in some way on Marxian perspectives. In Fairclough's
words, such approaches ask, 'how do existing societies provide people
with the possibilities and resources for rich and fulfilling lives, how
on the other hand do they deny people these possibilities and
resources?'. They are critical of prevailing social and material
relations, and the ideologies that justify these unequal relations.
Critical digital research is a field of study that often focuses on the
tip of the spear of ideology and capitalist production in contemporary
society. In this chapter we will discuss different critical approaches
to this field, and how they relate to ethical standards and good data,
arguing that they demand new ideas in terms of what research we do, and
how we do it.

## Introduction

Data produced by people in their online interactions and transactions
has become a vital tool and commodity in digital capitalism, and is
likewise vitally important for many areas of critical digital studies:
we cannot analyse online sociality, interaction and labor unless we have
data produced by these processes. Digital social data present troubling
questions for critical digital researchers: What can be a way to improve
knowledge and understanding of digital society while fostering an
ethical approach towards digital data? How can we make sure that
academics avoid harming subjects? and at the same time, how can we avoid
reinforcing structures of domination/exploitation in our data
collection, storage and dissemination? In short, what is 'Good Data'
when it comes to critical research? In this chapter we want to use a
Marxian perspective as well as theoretical ideas developed in critical
media studies and digital sociology to discuss the use of digital data,
and suggest a methodology based on a critical ethical approach. We will
begin by discussing the online context where this data is produced, and
providing an overview of ethical and methodological literature related
to digital social data, before we focus in particular on the works of
Christian Fuchs, Antonio Casilli and Karen Gregory. We have selected
these authors because we feel that together they provide a
politico-economic interpretation of digital social data. Through this,
we will advance the argument that 'Good Data' is data that can be used
to highlight and critique the power dynamics connected to the use of
digital social data, by stressing the particular economic and
technological environment from where they are generated.

## Digital social data and platforms

Under contemporary capitalism, digital data is becoming increasingly
central in the relationship between companies, workers and consumers,
and a new site of growth and profitability following the decline in
manufacturing.[^15chapter15_1] This is most visible in areas of global informational
capitalism, where data is exploited by giant transnational corporations
(Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft etc). In this context,
'The platform has emerged as a new business model, capable of extracting
and controlling immense amounts of data':[^15chapter15_2] platforms enroll people in
the production process, and provide a variety of services or commodities
on a peer-to-peer level. These can be social interactions, as in
Facebook or Twitter, or services such as Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo and so
on. Data are at the centre of this 'platform capitalism'.[^15chapter15_3] 'Clicks',
'likes', 'tweets', as well as geolocation, traffic information, food
preferences, and all other activities and behaviors that leave digital
traces (including body data from wearable devices), are routinely
gathered and monetized by platforms. User-generated data, either as a
by-product of transactions or as metadata produced within platforms
online, are very valuable for data brokers, data analytics industries,
advertisement companies, artificial intelligence developers, but also
public bodies such as intelligence agencies.[^15chapter15_4]

Despite their massive value, the public lacks awareness of the
importance of their digital data. Platforms emphasize the joy of
participation rather than the 'costs' connected to these services,
creating an opaque system where the majority of users (with the
exception of technologists, activists and academics) are generally
unaware of their role in generating value for companies. Only very
recently, with the Cambridge Analytica case, a public discussion has
started. Cambridge Analytica has demonstrated how the personal data of
Facebook users (and similar platforms) are routinely employed without
their full awareness by corporations interested not only in commercial
but also political targeting and 'surveillance capitalism'.

## Methodological and Ethical Problems Raised by Academics About Digital Data

Discussions about opportunities and limitations of digital social data
have run for almost a decade. Scholars have been particularly concerned
with the possible ways to adapt methodologies to these new data,[^15chapter15_5] and
the relationship between 'old' methods and new 'natively digital'
methods.[^15chapter15_6] Optimistic and pessimistic views have piled up. A
'computational turn' in social research, initially fuelled by enthusiasm
for the opportunities of volume, velocity and variety of 'Big Data'[^15chapter15_7]
has been especially influential, but also widely criticized. Authors
have stressed the shortcomings of user-generated data (e.g. not suitable
for statistical sampling), especially when coupled with a strong
'data-driven'/empirical approach.[^15chapter15_8] Big Data have been especially
troubling because of their ideological implications: the belief that if
'bigger is better', and if we can analyse large data sets, then the type
of knowledge produced will be truer, more objective and accurate.[^15chapter15_9] In
contrast, more critical approaches to data studies have stressed that
data are 'never simply neutral, objective, independent, raw
representations of the world',[^15chapter15_10] but are produced by - and influence
- economy, society, and knowledge.[^15chapter15_11] This is why stronger normative
reflections on the ethics and politics of digital data and the role of
researchers are urgently needed.[^15chapter15_12]

Debates on the ethics of digital social data have been developing for
the past 20 years.[^15chapter15_13] Internet research ethics, and particularly their
practical application in the context of ethical approval of research
projects, are geographically and historically contingent. It is
important to acknowledge that what is considered best practice can vary
a great deal by time and place. In their overview of the preceding of 20
years of internet research ethics, Elizabeth Buchanan emphasises that
early ethical issues and positions, drawing on biomedical conceptions of
research participants and concerned with fundamental questions, were
problematised by the emergence of the social internet, and challenged
again by the increasing prominence of Big Data research.[^15chapter15_14] The rapid
pace of change driving digital technologies has consistently presented
new challenges for ethical research standards. For contemporary
researchers, Big Data is of particular concern. Conceptualising Big Data
as a social phenomenon as well as a collection of technologies, boyd and
Crawford define it as interplay of phenomena, combining the technologies
of very large data sets, the tools and techniques to analyse them, and
the resulting '*Mythology*' of knowledge claims associated with this
technology and analysis.[^15chapter15_15] In this paper we are concerned with Big
Data associated with 'social media interactions',[^15chapter15_16] but Big Data
itself extends far beyond social media, and into many disciplines and
industries besides digital social science. In discussing the ethical
implications of Big Data, boyd and Crawford emphasise what are now
familiar issues: the ambiguity around public and private spaces, as well
as issues around informed consent and potential harm, and the 'highly
context-sensitive' nature of online spaces ^.^[^15chapter15_17] While they argue
that it 'may be unreasonable to ask researchers to obtain consent from
every person who posts a tweet',[^15chapter15_18] they are also skeptical of
approaches that treat publicly available social data as 'fair game'
simply because it is public. Overall, they stress that ethically sound
research should reflect on issues of accountability, 'both to the field
of research and to the research subjects',[^15chapter15_19] which involves
considering the implications of a given research project.

Similarly, Zimmer[^15chapter15_20] uses Nissenbaum's[^15chapter15_21] idea of 'Contextual
integrity' as a decision heuristic to help researchers to understand and
address the ethical dimensions of big data research projects. The theory
of contextual integrity ties adequate privacy protection to the
preservation of informational norms within in specific contexts,
providing a framework for evaluating the flow of personal information
between agents to help identify and explain why certain patterns of
information flow are acceptable in one context, but viewed as
problematic in another.

While our research has occurred in a British context, what counts as
ethical internet research can vary extensively by country, and even
institution. Based in Denmark, Klastrup states that at the time of their
research, Danish universities did not have ethical review boards, nor
formal standards for ethical internet research, instead utilising a
system of 'collegial mentoring', though even in this case the AoIR
guidelines were adhered to by many researchers.[^15chapter15_22] In a specifically
United States context, the rapid pace of technological change appears to
have led to a situation where 'research regulations have not kept up
with the methods and stakeholders', [^15chapter15_23] typified by the lack of
regulatory response to the infamous Facebook contagion study.[^15chapter15_24] And
although there were widespread debates around the issue, there is still
a lack of broad institutional consensus as to whether such studies are
even unethical.[^15chapter15_25] Discussing internet research ethics in a
non-western context, Honglandarom[^15chapter15_26] highlights that internet research
in Thailand 'apparently suffers from lack of attention to ethical
concerns',[^15chapter15_27] due to a lack of clear national or institutional
guidelines and awareness, which they argue is broadly the case 'for
other Asian countries also'.[^15chapter15_28] Some, however, are more similar to our
experience of ethical review in a British university in terms of
restrictions. In their discussion of the Canadian system, where a
national ethical framework is applied by individual institutional
ethical review boards, Seko and Lewis [^15chapter15_29] emphasise that there exists
a 'gap in pragmatic guidelines' in how to best apply ethical judgements
concerning internet research.[^15chapter15_30] This lack of clear guidelines,
combined with the 'Unique ethical issues' presented by the blurred
private/public divide,[^15chapter15_31] difficulties in maintaining participant
anonymity, and difficulties in obtaining informed consent can lead
reviews to '*err on the side of caution*'.[^15chapter15_32] Clearly there is
variation in how researchers across the world experience obtaining
ethical approval, likely exacerbated by the aforementioned newness of
internet technologies and research methods.

In discussing other dimensions of digital ethics, some authors have
stressed that a robust approach should interrogate how subjectivity is
constructed in research datasets.[^15chapter15_33] However this storing of user data
in datasets can complicate the traditional identification of subjects,
and methods to protect personal data can still leave participants
identifiably, making consent and anonymity almost impossible to attain.
Metcalf and Crawford stress how precursor disciplines such as data
science computer science, applied mathematics and statistics have not
historically conducted human-subject research.[^15chapter15_34] As with some of the
cases outlined above, in many situations researchers are left to rely on
the underlying principles and guidelines of general research ethics
'stemming from shared principles of respect, beneficence, and
justice',[^15chapter15_35] as well as principles of informed consent as 'a general
rule' .[^15chapter15_36] One prominent set of ethical guidelines are those produced
by the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR). As Ess discusses, in
the 2002 first AoIR guidelines 'primary ethical theories and approaches
rested on the assumption that human identity is primarily singular and
individual'.[^15chapter15_37] However, he stresses how our idea of identity has
changed towards a more relational and collective conception. Necessarily
the idea of subject protection has to change towards a broader and more
inclusive conception of the different relationships (familial, social,
natural, and so on) that compose identity. In 2012, AoIR guidelines
extended the basic ethical tenets (i.e. fundamental rights of human
dignity, autonomy, protection, safety, maximization of benefits and
minimization of harms for research subjects) to digital research, at the
same time stressing the necessity to maintain a processual and flexible
approach.[^15chapter15_38] In general, it is recognised that a 'one-size-fits-all'
approach with regard to ethical decision-making is not viable.
Researchers have been developing empirical approaches to data collection
and reproduction aimed at reducing harms to subjects in research, for
example by reconstructing empirical examples, or making required changes
in order to maintain the original meaning and message while ensuring the
original content cannot be retrieved through searches.[^15chapter15_39]

In our view one of the most important aspects, as it has been stressed
by Savage and Burrows, boyd and Crawford as well as Andrejevic and
others, is the fundamental role of the specific production system where
the data are created and collected. Ten years ago, Mike Savage and Roger
Burrows argued that the mechanisms of capitalist organisation of society
were challenging the empirical methods in sociology.[^15chapter15_40] Thanks to
digital technologies, research and social data produced and gathered by
private actors outside academia were multiplying. They recognized the
necessity for a critical methodological approach, a 'politics of
methods', challenging the collection, use and deployment of social data
produced by 'knowing capitalism'. Despite this, they did not especially
explore the ethical implications that follow from critical
methodological innovation and research.[^15chapter15_41] However, Savage and Burrows
raised the point that academic research is now competing with market
research, and it is no longer the dominant party when it comes to
providing interpretations of society. boyd and Crawford use the concept
of 'ecosystem' to describe the new set of actors connected to the
analysis of digital data and the power relationship that exists between
them.[^15chapter15_42] Given this, it is increasingly apparent that the
technological and economical structure of platforms is the crucial
aspect when dealing with digital data in research.

Mark Andrejevic presents a critical account of the economic system where
digital data, and Big Data are produced, shared and processed.[^15chapter15_43] In
particular, Big Data allows the largest amount of information to be
available (Andrejevic calls it 'infoglut'), while data mining and
automated processing have become the core tenet of economic, marketing
and research methods. In this system, traditional concepts such as
anonymity and privacy lose their place, as even though subjects names
are anonymised, their information is systematically gathered and stored
by automated systems that have interest in profiling groups rather than
individuals. Moreover, these systems complicate the reliability of data,
as the data we use, especially content data, are data that are created
in the specific context of platform capitalism. Platforms' algorithms
curate and edit contents automatically. Recommendations and automated
system of curations have built-in priorities that have nothing to do
with content, but rather with the response they can get (in terms of
likes, retweets...). This may present the risk that researchers who are
using data uncritically risk basing their research on data that is
unduly influenced by the economic dynamic where it was created.

Based on this, a challenge for critical researchers is to produce valid,
ethical research in an ecosystem of capitalist production, while being
under pressure from private industry, and ethical regulations that
differ from one country to another. One possible approach to this is
through the concept 'accountability', which can be understood as more
encompassing than the concept of privacy protection.[^15chapter15_44] As we have
outlined above, accountability is not only directed towards the research
subject, but also towards the research field in a broader sense.
Accountability implies reflecting on the consequences of research
related to individuals, organizations and the public sphere, and towards
potential shifts in the ecosystem regarding the production, collection
and analysis of digital data. What can be a way to improve knowledge and
understanding of digital society while fostering an ethical approach
towards digital data? How can we make sure that academics avoid harming
subjects? and at the same time avoid reinforcing structures of
domination/exploitation in our data collection/storage and
dissemination? In short, what is 'good data' when it comes to critical
research? In formulating these questions we are particularly drawing on
Staksrud,[^15chapter15_45] whose questions for digital social research capture
concerns for ethical treatment of participants, as well as a concern for
critical and original inquiry. What we find fundamental in ethical
assessment of the use of digital data in research is that: Digital
social data are generated and circulated within a very specific
technological, political, social and above all economic order and, what
we do as researchers, the type of data we choose and the methods we use,
actively shape, change or re-shape this order.[^15chapter15_46]

## A critical approach to ethics

Here we will draw together the work of Antonio Casilli, Christian Fuchs
and Karen Gregory, to suggest a critical approach to ethics that
considers the economic and political order at the origin of digital
social data. These authors share similar perspectives on good data in
digital research, stressing the necessity to ground data ethics in a
critique of neoliberal economic system and digital labor. We will build
on their work to suggest that good data is data conceived in a way that
emphasizes the role of the internet in the extension and reproduction of
capitalist relations of production and subjectivity, and is used for
positive, progressive political and social change through critical,
empirical research. The authors (Fuchs, Casilli, Gregory) challenge the
positive idea of digital social data and related ideas of 'participatory
culture', by considering economic and political relations, and seeing
social media as capitalist relations of production extended into an
online space. Researchers have to contrast the positive rhetoric
associated with big data and platforms, helping to raise critical
awareness of the issues related to digital social data. In this view,
good data are the ones that help pointing out the subordination
processes enacted through the platform economy, with the explicit aim of
obtaining the recognition of fundamental rights for users, the
redistribution of the value extracted by users' data and the rebalancing
of power relations connected to digital technologies. At the same time
researchers can reach outside academia and valorize the initiatives of
civil society, unions and other movements also by using the very same
platform structure for the purpose of creating a democratic programme,
based on the idea of commons, abolition of wage labor and private
property.[^15chapter15_47]

## Data as a product of labor

As we mentioned previously, platforms are elements of global
informational capitalism,[^15chapter15_48] and serve as an extension of capitalist
material processes and tendencies into online spaces and
infrastructure.[^15chapter15_49] 'Platformization' (i.e. the gradual movement of
companies towards a platform organisation) is at the origin of the
increased amount of digital social data available to academic
research.[^15chapter15_50] In this system, social media users are essentially
configured as laborers, who in their internet use perform different
forms of work. Value in platform capitalism is captured and extracted
from users' data.[^15chapter15_51] This process is presented as an improvement in
the supply of goods and services, either public or private, often
instrumentalising concepts such as 'sharing', 'participation',
'collaboration' for commercial purposes. On Facebook the activities that
users typically engage in all produce commodities in the form of
information, social relationships and social networks. Facebook makes
money off of these activities by selling ad space, and through targeted
advertising, with users enabling this through the visibility and
engagement their interactions generate, and by being the recipients of
targeted advertising. These relations extend to other social media
platforms: Twitter, YouTube and Google all make their money off of
users' labor in similar ways.

## Ethical problems from this point of view

As mentioned above, Big Data's nature is quite opaque, and when owned by
private companies may be subject to restrictions and suffer from a lack
of transparency. Moreover, as stressed by Andrejevic, data do not happen
in a vacuum, they are produced within specific technological and
economic environment. However, the algorithms that regulate data
visibility, extraction and processing are closed for technical and
commercial reasons. Digital social data are also at risk of
discriminatory practices. Companies have been eroding privacy of users
through the massive recovery of information about individuals (e.g.
geolocalisation, expenses, health, opinions and behaviours).
Cross-referencing users data, companies are able to profile individuals
(also non users) into different 'populations' in order to direct
advertisement and policies. Implicit in this 'data-veillance' system is
the idea of intrusion, both from public as much as private actors (i.e.
state surveillance revealed by Edward Snowden in 2013 and more recently
Cambridge Analytica), which can lead to forms of discrimination, making
it very easy to penalize individuals for their gender, age, ethnic
origin, place of residence or socio-economic status. The rhetoric of
choice and entrepreneurialism associated to the use of these platforms
hides the social cost connected to these data, costs in terms of
exploitation, privacy, and the extreme lack of transparency on their
usage.[^15chapter15_52] People are said to have a choice, and told that they can
improve their opportunities through the use of these platforms, however
all activities monetized by platforms are denied the 'materiality' as
real work, eroding users of their rights, and profoundly enriching
transnational companies. Created to parse users into database of
population, digital data will never be neutral, as they are with all the
concerns connected to the division of population into categories.[^15chapter15_53]
From this perspective, individual privacy without critique remains part
of the neoliberal rhetoric behind digital platforms. Casilli highlights
how in this diffuse system of surveillance and extraction of value,
privacy can no longer be conceived as an individual, but rather as a
collective right. Conceiving privacy as something that an individual can
negotiate, contributes to maintain users' weakness in face of the giant
corporations.[^15chapter15_54]

## Ethical approach in research

For Fuchs, research ethics is dominated by contradictory positions: on
one hand 'big data positivism' contends that since social media data is
generally public, both in visibility and in the sense that users are not
guaranteed privacy by terms and conditions, privacy and ethical concerns
can be disregarded. On the other hand, 'research ethics fundamentalism'
argues that since user intention and the consequences of reproducing
data cannot be guaranteed, informed consent should always be sought
Fuchs.[^15chapter15_55] Clearly, neither is ideal for critical social research, and
while some more recent guidelines have recommended that digital scholars
'neither ignore nor fetishize' ethics in conducting research, there is a
need to develop this position.[^15chapter15_56]

### 

## Challenging dominant rhetoric 

Researchers have to contrast the positive rhetoric associated to big
data and platforms, helping to raise critical awareness of the issues
related to digital social data. In this view, good data are the ones
that help pointing out the subordination processes enacted through the
platform economy, with the explicit aim of obtaining the recognition of
fundamental rights for users, the redistribution of the value extracted
by users' data and the rebalancing of power relations connected to
digital technologies. At the same time researchers can reach outside
academia and valorize the initiatives of civil society, unions and other
movements also by using the very same platform structure for the purpose
of creating a democratic programme, based on the idea of commons,
abolition of wage labor and private property.[^15chapter15_57]

## Reflexivity

Drawing from Marx and Engel's historical materialist method, Gregory
presents a critical definition of the work of digital researchers.
Intellectual thought, ideas and concepts produced by academic work are
themselves a product of the capitalist mode of production and contribute
to reproduce the order.[^15chapter15_58] For this reason, researchers should engage
in a reflexive critique of methods and data, documenting and making more
transparent the challenges presented by data created in a capitalist
system of production. Against the common practice of omitting the
discussions on complications, researchers have to make their methods
more transparent, helping to understand how difficulties and obstacles
contributed to shape their research. Such a reflexive approach is
necessary to realize how we as academics are reproducing the world that
we live in. In particular, digital researchers should help developing
new political vocabulary, rethinking concepts and developing new methods
and tools of analysis to create new models outside the profit-driven
logic of the extractive system and move towards anti-racist justice,
political, and economic solidarity.[^15chapter15_59]

Fuchs' 'critical moral real\[ist\]'[^15chapter15_60] approach is useful here. This
position argues that since beliefs about the social world are themselves
part of the social world, it is entirely appropriate for social
scientists to make value judgments about them and to work towards
resisting them through research. In the case of critical digital
research, this means doing research in a way that works towards
'participatory democracy, freedom, justice, fairness and equality',[^15chapter15_61]
and opposes things that work against those goals. In short, a critical
moral realist approach to social media may prioritize the political goal
of critique of power over the interests of participants who are
reproducing systems of power. Something similar to this position can be
found in existing best practice: the Economic and Social Research
Council (ESRC) framework for research ethics stipulates that it may be
legitimate to expose research participants to risks, 'in cases where the
objectives of the research are to reveal and critique fundamental
economic, political or cultural disadvantage or exploitation'.[^15chapter15_62] Even
in this case of a major research council suggesting that the
emancipatory objectives of research may justify the exposure of
participants to risk, 'Principles of justice' should still guide
researchers to minimise personal harm.[^15chapter15_63] As such, critical research
should not treat its motivations as carte-blanche justification for
potentially harmful or risky practice.

## What is to be done? 

We began this chapter by posing questions around how researchers might
develop a concept of good data that is rooted in an explicitly critical
approach: one that allows for rigorous critical research that is
cognizant of ethical issues, and also of the nature of social media as a
form of capitalist production. Here, we will draw on the concepts we
have discussed in order to address these questions.

In adopting more traditional, subject-oriented perspectives on ethical
problems connected to digital data, researchers risk constructing users
and data in a way that uncritically reproduces neoliberal approaches,
becoming 'agents' of the same power system, which is problematic for
research that seeks to build foundational critique of digital political
economy, subjectivity and ideology online. A critical perspective that
situates digital social data within the system of production where the
data are produced highlights the exploitation and deep inequalities that
are embodied in the data. Personal data online are a lucrative commodity
and the basis of an extremely opaque and unequal commercial ecosystem,
where users/workers are rarely aware of the different interests
connected to them. Critical data scholars, such as Fuchs, Casilli and
Gregory stress how data are being employed to produce risky social and
economic relations: precarisation of work, data-veillance, profiling,
algorithmic management of people.[^15chapter15_64]

When working to formulate ethical approaches for critical digital
research, both big data positivism and research ethics fundamentalism
are especially troubling for critical researchers, as each represents a
reproduction of the internal logics and ideology found in corporate
social media within social research. In the case of big data positivism,
users' data is seen as something unambiguously open, something that a
user has agreed to forfeit control over by agreeing to terms and
conditions, with the only controlling party being the platforms who own
said data. The consequence of this logic is best seen in the emerging
controversy around the data analytics company Cambridge Analytica. In
March 2018, the Guardian and the New York Times published a series of
articles that allege the misuse of a huge amount of user data taken from
Facebook by a political influence/analytics firm called Cambridge
Analytica. The story acquired attention because Cambridge Analytica had
important relationships with some of Donald Trump's closest
collaborators, especially during the 2016 US election campaign. The case
has brought to the attention of the large public how data-veillance
capitalism operates, confirming the fact that the vast majority of
platforms' users are totally unaware of how their data are monetized and
used to influence policies. On the one hand, the case indicates that the
rhetoric of individual privacy, stressed for long time by platforms
(i.e. 'Facebook users have control of their privacy' option) is a cover
for the extraction of value from users' and also non-users data (i.e.
profiles and shadow profiles). It is also significant that the resulting
scrutiny from the press and public is not confined to Cambridge
Analytica, but as it develops seems to be expanding to Facebook itself,
and how it handles users' data.

The case is useful to stress the necessity of being critical of
accepting the meanings associated with digital data. Digital social data
acquire their 'goodness' from the moment we use them not only as
indicators of social reality, but also as a means to start questioning
the image of society they present as a part of the political and
economic system from where they derive.

Applying critical perspectives to digital social data means challenging
the real significance of big data metrics and analytics as the product
of the specific ecosystem at the origin of digital social data. The
social implication of metadata fields structure what is described and
what is excluded, and the social categories that are created/reinforced
or reproduced. For instance, the most used metadata in academic research
are those connected to tweets. Twitter's data includes information about
users' accounts names, followers, connections (retweets, replies)
location, content, devices.[^15chapter15_65] But how are these categories really
experienced by users as bodied people? Adopting the number of followers
(or retweets) as a measure of influence for instance, are we really
measuring a social variable or are we rather describing the results of
platforms' internal logic of profit?[^15chapter15_66] Asking these questions force
us to recognize the power struggles behind the data we scrape or
download.

Likewise, research ethics fundamentalist positions are troubling to
critical scholarship. As Fuchs argues, approaches to research ethics
that fetishize privacy and ethics do so without regard for wider social
issues that may be pertinent to the data being studied,[^15chapter15_67] for example
by serving as protection for users engaging in the reproduction of
hateful discourses.[^15chapter15_68] We argue that this position serves to reproduce
a kind of neoliberal subjectivity in how we construct research
participants, by constructing the social media user as someone who has
complete sovereign ownership of their data, of all data being private,
of all use of data being subject to some kind of individualistic
consent, regardless of what is being studied. In a situation where
access to socially relevant data is often predicated on amicable
relations between researchers and corporate social media platforms,
critical researchers should take great care that we do not reproduce the
kind of subjectivities and logics of ethics and methodology that grow
from the ideologies found in the social media industry.

In discussing the privacy fundamentalism, Fuchs presents the following
question a researcher might ask a potential participant: '"Dear Mr.
Misogynist/Nazi, I am a social researcher gathering data from Twitter.
Can you please give me the informed consent that I quote your violent
threat against X?"'.[^15chapter15_69] This scenario may seem ridiculous, but in our
personal experience is exceedingly accurate in describing the logical
consequences of trying to do critical research. For one of us, critical
discursive analysis of misogynistic, anti-feminist and sexist language
on Twitter has been the primary focus of their research during their
postgraduate education, and the above is broadly indicative of the
situation they found themself in when fulfilling the conditions of their
ethical approval.[^15chapter15_70] While the institutional ethical standards applies
to that project were not quite as extreme as the positions outlined by
Fuchs, they still required that informative consent be obtained from
participants who produced more serious and abusive content. While the
motivation behind this is an ostensible concern for the potential
consequences to participants' welfare of reproducing their data in
another context, the effect was that 'the very act of producing hateful
discourse is turned into a barrier to the scrutiny of this
discourse'.[^15chapter15_71] From a critical perspective, this has the perverse
consequence of protecting and privileging those users who produce the
most extreme discourse, over those who would be the potential or actual
targets. Although this is not necessarily representative of the ethical
standards applied to all digital social research, it is still an example
of how a particular interpretation of ethical standards can act as a
barrier to critical scrutiny.

## Conclusions

In this chapter we discussed the argument for a critical approach to
ethics based on digital labor studies, in order to advocate for what we
see as truly good data. The focus on the link between digital social
data and the economic and technical environment where they are produced
labor is fundamental: big data are not 'just' data, they are labor, they
are political representation of the world, produced within a specific
system of material relations. We advocate for a view of data that grows
from this, one that calls critical researchers to reflect on how they
are not simply accountable to their participants as individualized,[^15chapter15_72]
neoliberal subjects, but accountable to the largest set of relationships
that compose contemporary concept of identity. As boyd and Crawford and
Ess suggest a form of accountability that move beyond the single
individual, we argue that the real ethical position of researcher is to
be accountable towards the commons, as a specific alternative to the
neoliberal capitalist system of production of data. As critical
researchers we have a unique opportunity to occupy the emerging field of
digital studies, and counter the rhetoric of reproduction of neoliberal
approaches to data, methods and subjectivity, such as participation,
entrepreneurialism and individualism. Such approaches are already
ubiquitous in the social media and data analytics industries, and while
the apparent greater concern for the ethical use of user data expressed
in academia is undoubtedly an improvement over the bleak cynicism of big
data capitalism, these approaches cannot hope to fundamentally challenge
industry unless they problematize the basic assumptions of what makes
good data. As we have discussed above, such an alternative - one that
identifies social media as a form of capitalist production - would
require a critical materialist reading of relations of production on
social media, as well as fundamental changes in approaches to
subjectivity, and a new approach to research ethics that builds on these
ideas, with the intention of empowering critical research to target how
systems of domination, exploitation and hate are propagated on social
media and through the relations of production that underline it. If
critical researchers are going to advance a challenge to the ideology,
assumptions and relations of production advanced under digital
capitalism, they must develop a way of ethically working with user data
that is based on achieving these goals. Away from perspectives that
treat data as something uncomplicated, or unsuitable for use in
critique, and towards good data: data that can be used to affect
meaningful change at the edge of modern capitalism.
