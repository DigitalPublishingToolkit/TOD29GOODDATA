Abstract:   In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the collection, aggregation and automated analysis of information by government and private actors, and in response to this there has been a significant critique regarding what could be termed ‘bad’ data practices in the globalised digital economy. 
In order to paint an alternative, more optimistic but still pragmatic picture of the datafied future, this book examines and proposes ‘good data’ practices, values and principles from an interdisciplinary, international perspective. From ideas of data sovereignty and justice, to manifestos for change and calls for activism, this collection opens a multifaceted conversation on the kinds of futures we want to see, and presents concrete steps on how we can start realising good data in practice.

# 12: Governance of Communal Data Sharing

*Chih-hsing Ho [^12chapter12_†] and Tyng-Ruey Chuangt[^12chapter12_††]*

**Abstract**

The rapid development of the data economy calls for innovative research
into its social and ethical impacts. When enormous opportunities emerge
along with making use of vast amounts of data, challenges are generated
and concerns arise around monopoly and market enclosure. Current legal
and regulatory frameworks for data protection fail to address these
devastating problems. By focusing on consent and the anonymisation of
data, these legal techniques echo the neoliberal methods of governance
which promise individual autonomy and choice as an advanced liberal
strategy. This article proposes theoretical and computational approaches
to the analysis of an alternative data sharing model, which is based on
community participation in decision making and self-governance. We
consider several examples, such as user data cooperatives and
collaborative data projects, to further explore how a community is
formed and how the governance of communal data sharing is being
established. We will then develop frameworks for the governance of
communal data sharing by combining common pool resource management and a
socio-legal perspective on the commons.

## Introduction

Today we see many states as well as *private* initiatives to promote
a *data*-driven industrial revolution across the globe. Data, said to be
like oil a century ago, has been cast as a new type of resource fuelling
an emerging, lucrative digital-era industry.[^12chapter12_2] However, the wealth
derived from this digital revolution is not being evenly distributed.
According to a study by the Economist, all five of the most valuable
listed companies in the world --- Apple, Alphabet (Google's parent
company), Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft are tech titans.[^12chapter12_3] Digital
wealth is being monopolized and concentrated in very few hands. Such
dominance has led to such side effects as unfair competition,
manipulation, routine intrusion of privacy, and the undermining of
democracy.[^12chapter12_4] These tech giants provide the infrastructure undergirding
much of the data economy, and stand to gain the most from it. Although
most of their services appear to be free, what underlies the
transactions of the digital economy is an exchange of services for
control over data. The challenges posed by capitalist accumulation of
data raise the question: is this monopoly inevitable? How are we to
imagine and create different systems, fairer systems featuring greater
participatory control?

This article proposes theoretical and computational approaches to the
analysis of an alternative data sharing model, which is based on
community participation in decision making and self-governance. When we
talk about 'community', we use this term in a non-conventional way. We
try not to see community as a fixed group or a predefined collective
identity. Rather, it refers to a set of ongoing engagement and practices
of group making.[^12chapter12_5] In other words, it is this dynamic process of
community making --- acts of mutual support, negotiation and
experimentation, as David Bollier has argued --- that are needed to
build innovative systems to manage shared resources.[^12chapter12_6] Along with
these curiosities, we consider several examples, such as user data
cooperatives[^12chapter12_7] and collaborative data projects,[^12chapter12_8] to further explore
how a community is formed and how the governance of communal data
sharing is being established. We will then develop frameworks for the
governance of communal data sharing by combining common pool resource
management and a socio-legal perspective on the commons.

## Data for All? A Communal Approach

Historically, the governance of shared resources has challenged many
great minds. For those who hold the view that competitive market
promotes economic efficiency, the privatization of shared resources is
one of the best ways to achieve their goal. As promoting efficiency is
the core value under this endeavor, *how* the surplus is generated and
*who* makes decision about its distribution are not central concerns of
capitalists. That said, the social practice of commoning is a
political-economic alternative to standard capitalist practice.[^12chapter12_9] For
commoners, what is more important is the *fair* conditions under which
surplus is produced, and that the decision making about the surplus to
be distributed involves those who take part in the process of
production.[^12chapter12_10] Applying the idea of the commons to the data economy,
this participatory form of data sharing addresses the well-being of
others through a process of democratizing ownership.[^12chapter12_11] But the
differences between the market and the commons go even beyond
participation. Commoners need to communicate with one another to develop
the norms, protocols or rules that govern access and the management of
shared resources they co-own. In this process of commoning, all parties
are stakeholders and are equally affected and bound by the governing
rules they discuss, negotiate and then agree upon. By taking
responsibility and claiming entitlement to form and govern the common
pool, commoners develop spaces of ethical and social connection. It is
such ongoing social relationships that help build distinct communities
in which commoners form their own subjectivities.

Current legal and regulatory frameworks for data protection fail to
address the devastating problem of market enclosure. By focusing on
consent and the anonymisation of data, these legal techniques echo the
neoliberal methods of governance which promise individual autonomy and
choice as an advanced liberal strategy. The Facebook-Cambridge
Analytical scandal is one example of the inadequacy of these mechanisms
in which trust was breached when Facebook failed to perform its role as
a dutiful data controller by allowing Cambridge Analytical, a third
party user, to access user data for very different purposes than that
agreed to by data subjects who contributed their data only to access
free services provided by Facebook. A communal data sharing model can be
an alternative providing a bottom-up initiative to address these
challenges.[^12chapter12_12] However, how to set up this adequate model remains an
issue yet to be solved. On the one hand, an effective system is required
to encourage the establishing of incentives for data sharing within the
community in a confidential and trustful manner. On the other hand,
commoners have to recognise the need to differentiate between the degree
of confidentiality within and outside of the communal boundaries. In
this paper we will investigate and develop normative principles and
computational frameworks to fully address these issues.

For communal data sharing, we refer to a communal approach of data
management where members of a community voluntarily pool their data
together to create a common pool for mutual benefits.[^12chapter12_13] This common
pool of data acts as a common resource of collective ownership to be
accessed by third party users when properly aggregated and distilled
according to its governance framework, which is initiated and agreed by
all members of the community. Usually, three main actors are involved in
data governance - data subjects, data controllers (and processors), and
third party data users. Although data subjects contribute data, it is up
to data controllers to decide how data is accessed and processed. In
most cases, third party users who plan to access the data pool may hold
very different, if not conflicting, interests from the data subjects. In
reality, it becomes difficult for data subjects to trace and verify if
data controllers have fulfilled their duties and the promises made prior
to data collection.

What challenges this conventional model of data governance is that the
three actors -- data subjects, data controllers, and data users -- do
not share common views and interests on how they wish the data to be
shared and reused. In practice, a common approach is for data
controllers to anonymize personal data before the data to be released,
and/or adopt restricted access model so that only certain users or
queries are allowed to access data warehouses. However, this operation
is not without limitations. As data science makes progress, thorough
anonymisation may not be possible when risks of re-identification
remain.[^12chapter12_14] As for restricting data access on a case-by-case basis,
meeting the different expectations and requirements of data subjects and
third party users challenges the possibility of stakeholders negotiating
and agreeing to their data governing rules.

## A Decentralized & Self-Governance Model 

A communal approach to data sharing aims to create a decentralized model
under which data subjects and data controllers are united rather than
separated.[^12chapter12_15] In other words, norms and principles for data use can be
decided upon data subjects who are members of the community. Also, it is
up to them to negotiate how their data shall be collected and used, as
well as who can access to this communal data pool. Several notable
experiments illustrate this kind of peer-based information production
and sharing. Wikipedia,[^12chapter12_16] OpenStreetMap,[^12chapter12_17] and Social.Coop[^12chapter12_18]
are examples. They demonstrate that data can be aggregated, shared and
managed by the peers themselves for the maximum of communal benefits. In
addition, these initiatives also show that data management can be
achieved from the bottom-up through grass root efforts.

Take Social.Coop as a case study. It is a social network platform
operated through Mastodon,[^12chapter12_19] a free and open-source software for
microblogging. The operation of Mastodon is done via open protocols as
its main purpose is to provide a decentralized alternative to
commercial, monopolizing services in communication. Mastodon emphasizes
a distributed and federated network of peer communication nodes.
Attracted by its ethical design and non-commercial characteristic,
Mastodon has been used by many communities to provide a service platform
of no data advertising, mining and no walled gardens. Social.Coop
follows these similar non-commercial and non-monopoly principles and
operates itself as a co-operative microblogging service based on
Mastodon. Its co-op operation emphasizes democratic principles of
transparency and participation. In practice, it relies on several
functional committees composed by members to establish a code of conduct
and other policies in order to reach collective decisions for platform
governance. All members of the Social.Coop are entitled to co-manage the
platform where the community is served, and to take part in creating
their own bylaws. The philosophy behind such self-governance model is to
foster trust by means that increase data subjects' control over their
data management based on their co-ownership.

Under this communal based, self-governance framework, the aggregated
data becomes a common-pool resource. Its management is governed by
community norms and bylaws set up by the peers who contribute to the
data pool. Aggregation, distribution, and all other data management
tasks can be facilitated by this open and transparent system. Further,
all the source code of the entire information system of this communal
design is open and free for everyone to review and improve upon. Based
on these cases of communal data sharing, we will further propose norms,
principles and techno designs to help lead to success of the communal
data sharing model.

## Governing the Data Commons 

The Data Commons generates important benefits in terms of building civic
trust and shared commitments. The question is how to govern such a
commons to make it sustainable. This is perhaps the main challenge we
would face while finding ways to protect not only the interests of
individual members, but also the integrity of the community, namely the
shared resource itself. David Bollier has studied the origins of free
software and the Creative Commons licenses. He found that although
commoners may assert different notions of social norms and community
boundaries, there is one similarity among them, and that is the use of
the commons to connect people.[^12chapter12_20] For Bollier, a commons serves not
only as a shared resource, but appeals to something very deep in
humanity. How have commoners organized to build their commons, such as
online communities, to improve data management and reclaim their common
wealth remains an interesting question worthy of further study.

Garrett Hardin argued in his famous 1968 essay 'The Tragedy of the
Commons'[^12chapter12_21] that the commons is a failed management regime as when
everything is free for the taking, the common resource will be overused.
He proposed that the best solution to this tragedy is to allocate
private property rights to the resource in question. However, what
Hardin observed is not really a commons but an open, or we can say
unlimited access, regime. The main difference between the two is that in
a commons, commoners share a mutual interest to maintain their shared
resources. This common expectation helps form a distinct community,
which is lacking in the unlimited access regime in which people do not
interact with one another and therefore there is no community consensus
being formed. Later, economist Elinor Ostrom offered eight principles
based on which she thinks that a commons can be governed in a more
sustainable and equitable way.[^12chapter12_22] These principles are proposed in
order to address issues associated with the tragedy of the commons.
Several questions were raised to be considered: what are mechanisms to
incentivise sharing? What ways can benefits be fairly distributed? What
are the methods to enforce the boundary of a group? What workable
procedures are available to form censuses and decisions, among others?

Here are Ostrom's eight principles for the governance of a commons:[^12chapter12_23]

1.  Define clear group boundaries;

2.  Match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and
    conditions;

3.  Ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying
    the rules;

4.  Make sure the rule-making rights of community members are respected
    by outside authorities;

5.  Develop a system, carried out by community members, for monitoring
    members' behavior;

6.  Use graduated sanctions for rule violators;

7.  Provide accessible, low-cost means for dispute resolution, and;

8.  Build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested
    tiers from the lowest level up to the entire interconnected system.

After further analysis, it is found that these principles may well apply
not only to classic common-pool resources (CPRs), which are made
available to all by consumption but access to which are limited by high
costs (e.g. fishing grounds and irrigation system), but also to
intangible information resources, such as knowledge and data (e.g.
software programs).[^12chapter12_24] Free software, whose source code is distributed
under licenses like the GNU General Public Licenses (GPL),[^12chapter12_25] is an
example of information commons. A GPL'ed software package can be used
and improved upon by anyone, and the enhancements to the package are
also free for all to reuse due to the copyleft nature of GPL. The GPL
license can be viewed as a way to set up boundaries. GPL'ed software is
free for all to use, and such freedom cannot be revoked. However, in
general, data is not copyrightable. Although some jurisdictions have sui
generis database rights, similar copyleft database licenses have been
developed. For example, the Open Database License (ODbL)[^12chapter12_26] has been
used to set a boundary for OpenStreetMap datasets.

When individuals are willing to pool their data for mutual benefits,
similar arrangements can be made to purposely restrict the information
flow of the pool. While GPL and ODbL aim to ensure that improvements are
free for all to reuse, the pool needs to remain within the community
boundary unless other arrangements have been made. Issues such as how to
formulate suitable data restriction polices, and how to effectively
enforce them, are central to any data sharing community. In addition,
due to the sensitivity of personal data, each individual may only want
to share partial data to the pool, and/or to remain anonymous when
sharing the data.

In addition, there are some proprietary structural designs being
developed to improve cooperative legalities in the management of shared
resources. A general asset lock is one example. It is often used in the
common ownership to set out a number of conditions to prevent residual
assets to be distributed amongst members when the organisation winds
up.[^12chapter12_27] But it also allows members to vote to change these provisions
in the governing document to convert the nature of the organisation from
a co-operative into a company. On the contrary, a statutory asset lock
includes provisions in the governing document in a prescribed format to
incorporate an organisation under specific legislation.[^12chapter12_28] It sets out
conditions so that assets can only be used for the benefit of the
community on dissolution of the organisation or be transferred outside
of a community interest company (CIC) when the prescribed requirements
are satisfied.[^12chapter12_29] These mechanisms of proprietary designs help not
only address problems of the tragedy of the commons, but also provide a
possible resolution for the sustainability of the commons.

## Computational Methods

There are several computational methods that can be used to facilitate
communal data sharing while maintaining confidentiality of data
subjects. When members share their private data with others in a
community, they often wish to ensure that their contributions are
confidential, at least to some degree. For example, they may not want
their identities to be revealed by other members in the same group. Even
if, under certain circumstances, they have to reveal their identities to
the group, they may not wish to disclose the same to those who are
outside of the group. When members' data leaves the boundaries of the
community for third party reuse, the data must be properly de-identified
to keep the data subjects anonymous. In some cases, such
de-identification efforts are futile, as even de-identified datasets can
still reveal characteristics of the entire community that is harmful to
every member of the group. For example, an anonymized dataset could
reveal that many data subjects come from higher income groups (e.g. by
their shopping habits and/or ZIP codes) or are susceptible to a
particular disease (e.g. by the characteristics and/or areas of their
upbringing).

These examples show that confidentiality is contextual and relative. A
person may be more willing to trust others in her or his own community,
but not feeling the same for those who are outside of the group. Data
use within the group, therefore, shall be treated differently than that
used outside of the community. When people form an ad hoc community to
share personal information about themselves (e.g. drug abuse), a certain
degree of anonymity is warranted; but they may still need ways to
identify one another in the group just to be able to communicate with
each other properly and in context. As for communication with others
outside of the group, however, member anonymity must be maintained. Now,
considering a situation where members can leave and join an ad hoc group
freely and at any time, maintaining workable group boundaries turns out
to be crucial if members are to be adequately protected.

Likewise, there is a need to call for suitable methods for auditing the
communal data sharing system. While maintaining confidentiality, members
of a community would still want to ensure that their data is, and will
always be, incorporated accurately and in full into the communal data
pool. In addition, they need ways to validate that other members'
contributions are authentic.[^12chapter12_30] When the communal data pool is
considered to be common resources, the community may want to keep track
of contributions from its members and to make sure that members access
the resource accordingly. This communal data pool needs to be used
wisely by people both within and outside of the group. We shall also
emphasize that in many scenarios, auditability needs to be achieved when
data are anonymised.

Here we list several computational methods that can be used for trustful
group communications. Many of these methods involve parties who would
like to cooperate anonymously to produce verifiable outcomes. A typical
scenario, for example, is to ask a group of strangers to form a
consensus without meeting face-to-face, and that each be able to verify
later that a certain consensus has been reached without knowing the
opinions offered by others. Below we exemplify three areas of this
promising research.

-   **Secure multiparty computation** is a subfield of cryptography that
    aims to provide methods for multiple parties to jointly compute a
    function over their private values without revealing them.[^12chapter12_31] For
    example, two employees can use a private equality test to see if
    they are paid the same while not revealing the amount of one's own
    salary. There are several methods for such a test. Methods for
    secure multiparty computation have been used for privacy-preserving
    data mining.

-   **Open-audit e-voting** is with regard to developing protocols and
    systems for online voting in which each voter gains assurance that
    his or her vote was correctly cast, and any observer can verify that
    all cast votes were properly counted. Helios[^12chapter12_32] is a protocol and
    a Web-based system for open-audit voting.[^12chapter12_33] It is shown that one
    can set up an election on the Web using Helios, and invite voters to
    cast a secret ballot, compute a tally, and generate a validity proof
    for the entire process. In many cases, a group can use secret ballot
    voting to aggregate sensitive information and to form consensus,
    such as selecting a leader to the group while not revealing the
    preference of anyone involved.

-   **User-centric online services** let Web users keep their personal
    data in their own devices and/or on storage servers that act as
    intermediaries to other online services. The data is likely stored
    encrypted. When user data is requested by a Web site, for example,
    while a user is logging into a social media site, encrypted user
    data is sent to the site on a need-to-know basis and decrypted.
    Sieve is such a system.[^12chapter12_34] Dissent is a general protocol offering
    provable anonymity and accountability for group communication .[^12chapter12_35]
    It addresses the need to balance between provably hiding the
    identities of well-behaved users, while provably revealing the
    identities of disruptive users.

Confidentiality and auditability requirements are highly contextual.
While these computational methods and systems are effective in their
respective application domains, they may not meet the communication
needs in a communal setting for data sharing. Many of the existing
methods assume two kinds of actors: individuals and their adversaries.
The assumption often is that every individual acts only for oneself. In
a communal setting, there are various data sharing communities, and an
individual can belong to many different groups. As each community may
have its own data sharing policy (intra-group and inter-group), we
anticipate that existing methods may require combination and/or use in
layers to effectively address technical problems arising from communal
sharing of personal data.

Here, we use a hypothetical example to further illustrate how the above
computational methods can be used together to initiate and facilitate
group communication concerning sensitive personal information. Suppose
that there was an outbreak of disease in a population, but people were
not willing to share their personal information. For those suspecting
that they were exposed to similar hazards, they may be more willing to
communicate with one another. Secure multiple-party computation methods
can be developed to allow people to check whether they have a similar
travel history -- countries visited in last six months, for example, but
without revealing where they went exactly. Open-audit e-voting methods
will then allow these people to aggregate and share information without
revealing their identities ('write in' one\'s major medical conditions
and make tallies, for example). After the vote and tally, and based on
the outcome, some people may be more willing to engage in group
conversations (though remain private among themselves). In such a case,
user-centric online services can be deployed to help host such
conversations.

## Conclusion 

The rapid development of the data economy calls for innovative research
into its social and ethical impacts. When enormous opportunities emerge
along with making use of vast amounts of data, challenges are generated
and concerns arise around monopoly and market enclosure. We need to
ensure that the rapidly developing data economy evolves in fair and
justifiable ways. In order to make possible this goal, it is crucial
that an innovative, bottom-up and de-centralized data governance
framework be designed, through which a trustful space arises such that
all stakeholders are able to fruitfully engage and take responsibility
for their communities.

A communal data sharing model is established based on these principles.
By forming a communal data pool, each member of the community is
entitled to take her or his entitlement and participates in the
collective decision-making on an equal footing. This involves also
incorporating collective ownership in data governance frameworks. The
central aspect of engagement facilitates communication among members of
the community. Such initiative relies not only on an effective
information system, but also on the process of commoning through which a
collective identity is formed. In contrast to the conventional data
protection framework paying primary attention to consent and data
anonymisation, the communal data sharing model emphasizes the amount of
control that individual subjects have over their data. It also deals
with who may have access to data in the communal pool, and with whom
such data may be shared. We therefore propose a communal data sharing
model to help create fairer platforms for everyone who takes part in
this brave new data-driven revolution.
