Abstract:   In recent years, there has been an exponential increase in the collection, aggregation and automated analysis of information by government and private actors, and in response to this there has been a significant critique regarding what could be termed ‘bad’ data practices in the globalised digital economy. 
In order to paint an alternative, more optimistic but still pragmatic picture of the datafied future, this book examines and proposes ‘good data’ practices, values and principles from an interdisciplinary, international perspective. From ideas of data sovereignty and justice, to manifestos for change and calls for activism, this collection opens a multifaceted conversation on the kinds of futures we want to see, and presents concrete steps on how we can start realising good data in practice.

# 7: Unlawful Data Access and Abuse of Metadata for Mass Persecution of Dissidents in Turkey: The ByLock Case

*A. Sefa Ozalp*

**Abstract**

This chapter presents a critical case study of unlawful metadata access
and retroactive criminalization of encryption to persecute perceived
dissidents by focusing on ByLock prosecutions in Turkey. Although ByLock
was a public and free encrypted mobile chat application, the Turkish
government argues that ByLock was exclusively used by the members of the
Gulen Movement (GM), which the Turkish government accuses of organizing
the failed coup attempt against President Erdogan in 2016. Under
post-coup measures, tens of thousands of alleged ByLock users have been
arrested under GM probe and handed down heavy prison sentences on
terrorism charges. This chapter aims to highlight the threat of 'bad
data' practices, such as criminalization of encryption, unlawful data
access and abuse of communications metadata to persecute perceived
dissidents, by unpicking the Turkish state's claims and the evidence
presented to courts by the Turkish state during the ByLock trials. By
doing so, this chapter contributes to current metadata retention and
lawful access debate by detailing material effects of metadata
exploitation for political purposes by government authorities. This
chapter contends that lessons learned from the ByLock case illustrate
how critical 'Good Data' principles and the integrity of encrypted and
secure communication channels are for democracies.

## Introduction

Digital communication technologies (DCTs) have altered the way we
generate, share and receive information. For the most part, DCTs have
made public and private communications faster, cheaper, and easier.
Although these advancements have been beneficial for people in general,
DCTs have introduced new threats to privacy and information security. As
the Snowden leaks revealed, DCT infrastructures have enabled state
actors to access 'bulk' digital communications data and increased the
surveillance capabilities of state actors exponentially.[^07chapter7_1] Dissidents,
minority populations and activists have been disproportionally affected
by the increased digital surveillance efforts of state actors.[^07chapter7_2]

In the age of DCTs, many fundamental rights essential for a 'Good
Democracy' - such as the freedom of expression, the freedom of political
thought, the freedom of religion, the freedom of association, and the
right to privacy - are dependent on having strong information security.
Freedom of expression is defined as the 'freedom to hold opinions and to
receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public
authority and regardless of frontiers' in the Charter of Fundamental
Rights of the European Union (CFR).[^07chapter7_3] In order to have a 'Good
Democracy', activists, dissidents, or people in general need to be able
to communicate securely to enjoy the freedom 'to receive and impart
information without interference by public authority'.[^07chapter7_4] Therefore,
'Good Data' and counter-surveillance practices such as online anonymity
and encryption tools are integral to having a 'Good Democracy'. Since
encryption is an essential tool to secure DCTs from state surveillance,
encrypted and secure communication platforms frequently come under the
attack by states, citing national security concerns.[^07chapter7_5] These attacks
constitute 'bad data' practices because they involve attempts to pass
backdoor legislation, unlawfully spying on dissidents, activists and
NGOs such as Privacy International,[^07chapter7_6] and the use of unlawfully
acquired or manipulated (meta)data to prosecute and/or persecute
government critics.

To illustrate the oppressive potentials of 'bad data' practices, I
introduce a case study of mass persecution of perceived government
critics over their alleged usage of an encrypted communication
application called ByLock in Turkey. ByLock was a free and public chat
application which was downloaded more than 500,000 times from the App
Store and Google Play Store between April 2014 and March 2016,[^07chapter7_7] when
it was deactivated when its developers stopped paying for the servers
hosting the app.[^07chapter7_8] Turkish Intelligence Agency (in Turkish Millî
İstihbarat Teşkilatı, henceforth MIT) claimed that ByLock was a secret
communication tool for Gulen Movement (henceforth GM) members - a social
movement that the Turkish government holds responsible for the failed
coup against Erdogan in 2016. In the aftermath of the coup attempt, the
Turkish government accused any individual with perceived links to GM of
being 'terrorists' and started an unprecedented purge. Shortly after the
coup attempt, Turkish media reported that the MIT had hacked ByLock's
servers in Lithuania, in an attempt to uncover ByLock users, perceived
to be Gulenists.[^07chapter7_9] MIT further claimed that they had identified
thousands of ByLock users via metadata provided by Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) and Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). Although the
number of individuals ensnared under the ByLock investigation has not
been officially released, Freedom House reported that 'Tens of thousands
of Turkish citizens have been arbitrarily detained for their alleged use
of the encrypted communications app ByLock'.[^07chapter7_10] Mass arrests based on
alleged ByLock usage have attracted severe criticism outside Turkey. The
UN Human Rights Council called ByLock prosecutions a 'criminalization of
encryption', noting that the 'evidence presented \[by Turkish
authorities\] is often ambiguous'.[^07chapter7_11] Amnesty International (AI)
criticized ByLock prosecutions by stating that 'possession of
internationally available and widely downloaded application does not
represent a criminal offence' and the 'Turkish Government's methods for
identifying users are seriously flawed in general'.[^07chapter7_12] Similarly,
Privacy International condemned the ByLock prosecutions and called for
the immediate release of those arrested solely for using ByLock.[^07chapter7_13]

Drawing on Cohen's moral panic theory,[^07chapter7_14] I conduct a critical
analysis of the post-coup measures taken by the Turkish regime,
especially focusing on evidence cited in ByLock prosecutions. I conclude
that the abuse of metadata to punish political enemies is not
necessarily limited to authoritarian governments such as Turkey, as
metadata are retained globally. By doing so, I present a cautionary case
study from Turkey, detailing material effects of metadata exploitation
for political purposes by government authorities, which digital
activists and scholars around the world can draw on in the metadata
retention and lawful access debates.[^07chapter7_15] I argue that the abuse of
metadata and unscrupulous law-enforcement powers can be easily justified
in 'moral panics' when 'a condition, episode, person or group of persons
emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and
interests'.[^07chapter7_16] I further argue that, supranational human rights
legislation may be ineffective to prevent state surveillance, privacy
breaches and metadata abuse. Finally, I contend that lessons learned
from the ByLock case illustrate the importance of the 'Good Data'
practices and the integrity of DCTs for 'good democracy'.

## Digital Communication Technologies, Metadata and State Access 

Before the emergence of DCTs, mass communication and public information
campaigns were conducted through pre-digital information sharing
mechanisms (ISMs) such as print media, radio, and television. Because of
the nation-state-led developments in the technological infrastructure
they relied on, pre-digital ISMs were relatively easier to influence for
states and the powerful.[^07chapter7_17] With the emergence of the internet and the
DCTs, some scholars and activists argued that these new media provided
an opportunity to overcome some of the above challenges. One of the
primary arguments brought forward was that the internet provided a
decentralized infrastructure that allowed active participation of
individuals online, which, in turn had the potential to disturb the
pre-digital ISMs.[^07chapter7_18] When equipped with 'Good Data' principles, DCTs
provided a window of opportunity for activists and dissidents to
revolutionize public and private communications. For instance, during
the Arab Spring protests, online social media networks served as 'a
common medium for professional journalism and citizen journalism, and as
a site of global information flow' which, allowed activists to overcome
state blackout and 'facilitating the revolutions'.[^07chapter7_19] The
revolutionary aspect of DCTs led some to believe - perhaps naively -
that DCTs could provide users with an opportunity to become anonymous
and protected from intrusive state surveillance. Current political,
legal, and academic debates, however, illustrates that this is not the
case.

One of the primary debates around DCTs concerns the retention of
metadata and risks to user privacy.[^07chapter7_20] In the context of DCTs,
metadata are information about communications that users leave behind
while using DCTs. For instance, while contents of the visited webpages
are data, IP access logs and timestamps stored by ISPs are metadata. All
user activities on DCTs, such as phone conversations, search queries,
emails, website visits, ad-clicks, social media activities, and
peer-to-peer messages, generate metadata which can be logged and stored
automatically. Riley called this perennial form of large scale
(meta)data collection 'dataveillance'.[^07chapter7_21] Metadata can be aggregated,
analyzed and sold to third parties. Using metadata, users can be
profiled based on their political leanings, ethnic background, and
sexual orientation. Inferences drawn from (meta)data analyses can be
used for anti-democratic purposes, such as election meddling, as
observed in the Cambridge Analytica case.[^07chapter7_22] Metadata expand the
surveillance capacities of state actors by revealing personal
information such as 'who', 'when', 'what (type of communication)',
'how', 'where' which, in turn, 'can provide very detailed information
regarding an individual's beliefs, preferences and behaviour'.[^07chapter7_23] In
fact, in the *Big Brother Watch vs UK* ruling, the European Court of
Human Rights (ECtHR) ruled that 'metadata can be just as intrusive as
the interception of content'.[^07chapter7_24]  Considering nation states are
actively trying to exploit DCTs using both legal and illegal means,[^07chapter7_25]
the ease of access to metadata can be especially dangerous for political
activists, dissident groups and perceived political opponents, who are
subject to disproportionate and intrusive state surveillance.[^07chapter7_26]

To date, national and supranational legal mechanisms have failed to
provide comprehensive privacy protection for individuals. Governments
around the world increasingly pass new laws that require metadata
retention based on the argument of public security, pre-empting crime
and terrorism.[^07chapter7_27] Even in the EU context, where mechanisms such as
CFR, ECtHR and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) provide
a supranational level of legal protection against human rights
breaches,[^07chapter7_28] it is hard to talk about sufficient legal protection
against government efforts to breach user privacy. For instance, the UK
Government passed the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014
(DRIPA) which required DCT providers to retain indiscriminate metadata
on the grounds of national security and crime prevention. Both the
Divisional Court and the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU)
held that DRIPA was incompatible with EU law.[^07chapter7_29] In a subsequent joint
case ruling, CJEU found that the mass collection and analysis of
metadata would lead to the violation of Article 7 \[Respect to private
and family life\] and Article 8 \[Protection of personal data\] of the
CFR, 'which could be justified only by the objective of fighting serious
crime'.[^07chapter7_30] Even though privacy organizations and activists welcomed
this ruling, the CJEU left it to Member States to define what
constitutes serious crime, hence the ability to adjust the balance of
privacy versus national security. Indeed, in December 2016, the UK
government replaced DRIPA with the Investigatory Powers Act which
replicated the problematic elements of the DRIPA i.e. requirement for
metadata retention and broad access by government agencies, even on
non-crime related grounds.

### Moral Panics and the Abuse of Metadata

To understand the true risks of metadata retention, it is beneficial to
look at cases where authoritarian regimes exploit communications
metadata to target political enemies and to facilitate oppression of
dissidents -- this is the focus of my analysis. In most cases,
oppression faced by dissidents is a perennial process. Historical
oppression of Kurds by the Turkish state and successive governments from
different political backgrounds is a prime example of the continual
oppression observed by dissidents.[^07chapter7_31] However, in some cases, new
political opponents can become targets. The latter is better observed
within moral panics emerging in the aftermath of political upheavals.

Goode and Ben-Yehuda's attributional model provides a useful theoretical
perspective for understanding moral panics.[^07chapter7_32] They propose five
defining 'elements of criteria' i.e. *concern, hostility, consensus,
disproportion* and *volatility* for moral panics. Authoritarian regimes
are adept at constructing and propagating a 'folk devil' narrative to
rationalize the persecution of political enemies and dissidents. These
oppressive efforts increase when moral panics emege. Folk-devil
narratives, constructed by authoritarian regimes, take advantage of
widespread public *concerns* 'over the behaviour of a certain group or
category'.[^07chapter7_33] *Concerns* may be latent in society or be *volatile*
i.e. surfacing suddenly following political upheavals. An example of the
latter would be socially disruptive incidents, such as terror attacks,
which act as 'trigger events',[^07chapter7_34] and result in a 'heightened level of
concern over the behaviour of a certain group or category.[^07chapter7_35] In the
aftermath of trigger events, the public becomes susceptible to be
influenced by constructed folk devil narratives and 'an increased level
of *hostility*' towards targeted groups may be observed.[^07chapter7_36] Actively
propagating 'folk devil' narratives may result in partial or complete
*consensus* that 'the threat is real, serious and caused by the
wrongdoing group members and their behaviour' across society.[^07chapter7_37] Once
there is a *consensus* of *hostility* towards the folk devils,
*disproportionate* social and official reactions may be observed.
Furthermore, disproportionate reactions may become '*routinized* or
*institutionalized'*, [^07chapter7_38] and lead to impulsive and reactionary
changes in 'legislation, enforcement practices, informal interpersonal
norms or practices for punishing transgressors'.[^07chapter7_39] As a result,
overreactions can even be more damaging than the original threat for the
public.

Correspondingly, abuse of communications metadata to confer criminality
upon political enemies and dissidents can be easily justified following
trigger events. As UNHRC Special Rapporteur David Kaye warned, 'efforts
to restrict encryption and anonymity also tend to be quick reactions to
terrorism, even when the attackers themselves are not alleged to have
used encryption or anonymity to plan or carry out an attack'.[^07chapter7_40]
Extra-judicial mass surveillance programs of intelligence agencies,
which would have been scrutinized and criticized by the public in normal
times,[^07chapter7_41] can be introduced in order to identify so-called
'terrorists'. Regimes can abandon established legal procedures and human
rights protections such as 'the burden of proof' or 'right to a fair
trial' in pursuit of punishing political enemies. The oppression of
dissidents can be facilitated by metadata abuse for political purposes
i.e. citing unlawfully accessed or unreliable communications metadata to
confer guilt on dissidents. To illustrate the oppressive potentials of
such metadata abuse, I will look at the reactions to the coup attempt in
Turkey, and the mass ByLock prosecutions in the aftermath.

## The Turkish Coup Attempt and the Subsequent Purge 

On 15 July 2016, a rogue group in the Turkish military took to the
streets to topple President Erdogan. The coup had little chance of
success: only a marginally small fraction of the Turkish military was
involved,[^07chapter7_42] and there was very little public support. While over two
hundred soldiers and civilians were killed during the clashes, no
government official was apprehended. By the morning, those involved in
the coup were arrested and the coup attempt was suppressed. President
Erdogan and the ruling Justice and Development Party (henceforth AKP)
ministers publicly announced that the coup was organized by the GM, a
social and religious movement who were at odds with the AKP at the
time.[^07chapter7_43] Erdogan personally called the attempt a 'gift from the God
(sic)' which would 'allow him to cleanse the army and the state of
terrorists \[i.e. perceived GM supporters\]'.[^07chapter7_44] On the other hand,
Gulen publicly denied any connection to the coup attempt, and called for
an international commission to investigate the attempt; further stating
that if any of his sympathizers were involved, they would have violated
his values.[^07chapter7_45] The extent of GM-linked individuals' possible
involvement in the coup attempt is beyond the scope of this chapter.
However, it is clear that following the coup attempt, GM faced extreme
stigmatization from Turkish society both inside and outside Turkey,
[^07chapter7_46] leading GM members to leave Turkey for other countries and seek
safety abroad.[^07chapter7_47]

In the immediate aftermath of the coup attempt, the AKP government
launched an unprecedented purge against perceived Gulenists. One day
after the coup attempt, more than 2700 judges were dismissed,[^07chapter7_48] and
many were later arrested.[^07chapter7_49] Even though the coup attempt was
suppressed within hours, AKP government declared a state of emergency
(henceforth SoE) and derogated from European Convention on Human Rights
(ECHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR). The derogation notice listed derogations from 13 articles such
as the right to liberty, security, fair trial, privacy, the humane
treatment of detainees, and the right to remedy, the latter two of which
cannot be subject to derogation under any circumstances, according to
the UN Human Rights Committee.[^07chapter7_50] Additionally, the SoE allowed the
AKP government to pass decrees without parliamentary scrutiny. For
instance, SoE decrees provided full financial, administrative and
criminal impunity to state officials for their actions during the SoE,
which resulted in frequent torture and ill-treatment of detainees,[^07chapter7_51]
mass arbitrary arrests, arbitrary dismissal of state employees, and the
removal of due process.[^07chapter7_52] Consequently, dismissals have extended to
perceived critics from other political backgrounds such as leftists,
human rights defenders and Kurdish politicians. According to the latest
figures,[^07chapter7_53] more than 170,000 civil servants, including academics,
teachers, police and military officers have been dismissed from their
jobs without due process,[^07chapter7_54] with 142,874 people detained and 81,417
people arrested.[^07chapter7_55] These negative legislative and judicial
developments have been demonstrated to be disproportionate, in breach of
Article 4(1) of ICCPR,[^07chapter7_56] and have had an extremely negative impact on
the rule of law and individual liberties in Turkey.

In parallel with the regressive judicial and legislative developments,
exploiting public concern and social tensions in the aftermath of the
failed coup attempt, pro-AKP media and influential AKP figures
constructed a 'Gulenist' narrative: covert terrorists and plotters
infiltrated into society and the state, trying to demolish the state
from within. Anyone suspected of being a GM member, supporter or
sympathizer is a traitor and a terrorist. In this context, any
activities performed by GM-affiliated individuals, such as charity work,
donations, working in GM-linked institutions, organizing religious
meetings or even simply *communicating with each other* have been
ostracized and criminalized. This was exacerbated by Erdogan's
presidential pleas for spying on family members and friends who are
suspected to be Gulenists and reporting them to authorities.[^07chapter7_57]
Drawing on moral panic theory, we can see that the coup attempt has
acted as a trigger event and the GM have been effectively declared the
folk devils --'a category of people who, presumably, engage in evil
practices and are blamed for menacing a society's culture, way of life,
and central values' in the aftermath.[^07chapter7_58] AKP government took advantage
of public *concern* in the aftermath of the coup attempt aimed to
construct a narrative to achieve *consensus* of *hostility* against GM.
This was followed by disproportionate social, legislative, and judicial
reactions. In this *volatile* social and political environment, it was
relatively easy for the AKP government to weaken the established legal
norms and individual safeguards their political enemies. It is fair to
argue that, rather than the coup attempt, it was the AKP government's
exorbitant and vindictive reactions to the coup attempt which resulted
in mass human rights breaches, the eradication of the rule of law and
individual liberties in Turkey.

## ByLock Prosecutions: Mass Arrest of Perceived Opponents on Terrorism Charges over Encrypted App Usage

ByLock prosecutions were built on inaccurate claims and proceeded with
disrespect to established legal standards and individual protections.
Shortly after the coup attempt, AKP-linked media outlets published
stories that coup plotters and their supporters communicated over ByLock
during the coup attempt.[^07chapter7_59] However, this claim is false, as Fox-IT
clearly illustrated that the Bylock.net domain was deactivated in March
2016, hence ByLock '﻿could not have been used in the period from April
2016 leading up to 15 July 2016'.[^07chapter7_60] The Turkish government also
claimed that MIT identified ByLock user lists using 'special cyber
methods' i.e. hacking Baltic/Cherry Servers in Lithuania which were
hosting the ByLock app.[^07chapter7_61] This means that MIT's access to ByLock
server data was unlawful and such unlawfully acquired data 'shall not be
presented before a court' and 'shall not constitute a factual ground for
a possible conviction' under Turkish criminal law.[^07chapter7_62] Both Lithuanian
authorities[^07chapter7_63] and Baltic/Cherry Servers[^07chapter7_64] declared that they
neither received a legal request from nor shared data with Turkish
authorities, confirming Gokce's unlawful access observation. This is
especially egregious because the ByLock prosecutions, which led to the
arrest of tens of thousands of perceived GM members, were built on
communication (meta)data accessed unlawfully.

Once the ByLock prosecutions started, MIT submitted a 'ByLock technical
report' to trial courts, and this report constituted the technical basis
of ByLock prosecutions.[^07chapter7_65] The MIT report claimed that ByLock: (1)
offered strong cryptography; (2) was disguised as a global application
(i.e. presenting itself deceptively as a global application while the
aim was to provide GM with an intra-organizational communication app);
(3) was aimed at security and anonymity; (4) used a self-signed
certificate; (5) offered communication only suitable for a
cell-structure (as ByLock did not ask for a phone number to register,
MIT argued that ByLock users could only exchange ByLock contact details
after initially meeting face-to-face); (6) was designed to prevent
access in case of legal confiscation; (7) offered identity hiding
features (such as an automatic self-destruct, using long passwords
features); and thus, concluded that 'ByLock has been offered to the
exclusive use of the 'FTÖ/PDY' members \[Gulenists\]'.[^07chapter7_66] Citing this
report amongst evidence, first instance courts sentenced thousands of
alleged ByLock users on terrorism charges (over alleged links to GM),
ranging from 6 to 15 years.[^07chapter7_67] The court of cassation, which acts as
the unifying court of appeals in criminal prosecutions in Turkey,
approved the evidential status of the alleged ByLock usage,[^07chapter7_68]
permitting the collective punishment of alleged ByLock users based on
dubious lists created by MIT.

Despite the grave consequences for alleged ByLock users, the MIT report
was found to be biased, insubstantial and unreliable when scrutinized by
the Dutch cyber security firm Fox-IT.[^07chapter7_69] By reverse engineering ByLock
app's source code and online fact-checking, Fox-IT addressed claims put
forward in the MIT report and found that: (1) 'security measures
implemented in ByLock are not exceptional and actually on par with
widely used chat applications';[^07chapter7_70](2) the disguise of global
application argument is 'not backed by evidence, questionable or
incorrect';[^07chapter7_71](3) ByLock developer's aim for security and anonymity
'does not imply an intent for use in illegal activities',[^07chapter7_72] and 'in
no way an indication that ByLock is aimed at a specific user
group';[^07chapter7_73](4) the incentive behind using a self-signed certificate is
not necessarily to prevent authorities accessing the ByLock data, as
self-signed certificates 'are easier to implement and are free of cost';
(5) rather than meeting face-to-face, users could have exchanged ByLock
details using another communication method (e g. WhatsApp, Facebook,
phone call), casting a shadow over MIT's 'ByLock was designed for
communications in a cell structure argument'; (6) MIT is 'jumping to
conclusions on the intent of the developer' when concluding ByLock was
designed to 'prevent access in case of legal confusion';[^07chapter7_74] and (7)
measures such as self-destruct and using long passwords is a common
feature also found in other communication applications such as Snapchat
and Signal. As a result, Fox-IT concluded that MIT report is 'biased
towards a predefined outcome', 'does not adhere to forensic principles',
and is 'fundamentally flawed due to the contradicted and unfounded
findings, lack of objectivity and lack of transparency'.[^07chapter7_75]

MIT report also raised serious doubts about the integrity of data cited
as evidence in ByLock prosecutions. Fox-IT noted that it is impossible
to verify whether MIT tempered with ByLock server data or not because
MIT did not calculate 'cryptographic hashes' of server data and did not
'generate an audit trail'.[^07chapter7_76] Given that MIT is reported to have
hacked ByLock servers, this is a crucial point that casts a great doubt
over the evidential status of ByLock server data cited in prosecutions.
In fact, screenshots used in the MIT report detailing the so-called
investigation of the server data contain multiple inconsistencies 'that
indicate manipulation of results and/or screenshots by MIT'.[^07chapter7_77] In
Figure 1, Gokce illustrates that the SQL query result screenshots
presented in the MIT report (allegedly from data acquired from ByLock
servers) are deliberately manipulated by MIT which '﻿points out the
great likelihood that MIT and other Turkish authorities manipulated the
Bylock database and fabricated false Bylock records'.[^07chapter7_78]


*Figure* *1: Screenshots from MIT report, allegedly from ByLock
database. Total numbers of rows returned by the SQL queries (7 and 10
respectively) do not match total numbers of rows shown at the bottom of
the query results (8 and 12 respectively). Figure taken from Gokce
(2018).*

Although manipulation of evidence is a serious claim, Gokce makes a
compelling argument that other not only MIT but also other Turkish
authorities may also have 'fabricated' communications metadata (internet
traffic records) to facilitate the sentencing of alleged ByLock
users.[^07chapter7_79] MIT report claimed ByLock users were identified by acquiring
IP address logs from the ByLock server database, but it omits methods
used to attribute these IP addresses to individuals. During criminal
proceedings, it was revealed that the state relied on internet traffic
metadata - namely IAL which contain information about date/time, public
and private IP address of the user, target IP of the server connected
amongst others - as evidence to identify individuals who communicated
with ByLock's servers.[^07chapter7_80] In Turkey, IAL are retained by the
Information and Communication Technologies Authority (Bilgi
Teknolojileri Kurumu in Turkish, henceforth BTK) which is the government
institution authorized to collect and store metadata provided from ISPs
and MNOs, which are private companies. In one scathing example of
metadata fabrication, Gokce presents an alleged ByLock user's mobile
IAL, which was exhibited to a criminal court during proceedings.[^07chapter7_81]
While the IAL produced by the MNO contains no data in the 'target IP'
column for the specified time frame, the IAL produced by the BTK lists
ByLock server's IP address in the 'target IP' column for the specified
time frame. As BTK can only store metadata provided by MNOs and ISPs,
one would expect no variation between IAL from BTK and MNO over the same
time frame. Given this, the fact that only the IAL provided by BTK had
'target IP' information (i.e. IP addresses of servers hosting the ByLock
app) indicates metadata manipulation and/or injection on BTK's side.
This is a crucial point that lends support for Gokce's ﻿'BTK doctored
internet traffic records it received from telecommunication companies'
argument.[^07chapter7_82] These, coupled with the fact that Turkish authorities
reduced the reported total number of ByLock users arbitrarily,[^07chapter7_83] led
critics to suggest that Turkish authorities have altered ByLock user
lists arbitrarily to target perceived GM supporters. [^07chapter7_84]

Even if we were to set aside claims of metadata manipulation, citing
communications metadata as evidence in criminal prosecutions is
unreliable because of IP-based attribution challenges. Without
corroborating offline evidence, using IP addresses alone to identify
individuals that are suspected for a crime is unreliable.[^07chapter7_85] This
issue is more frequently observed for mobile device IPs which connect to
internet over a network provided by MNOs. Around the world, 92% of MNOs
use Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT),[^07chapter7_86] which are
network designs that distribute a small number of global IP addresses to
many private users. This means, same public IP address can be shared by
hundreds of users at a particular time, making it almost impossible to
identify individual users via communications metadata. Indeed, EUROPOL
reported that '90% of European cybercrime investigators regularly
encounter attribution problems related to CGN technologies'.[^07chapter7_87]
Similarly, Turkish MNOs use CGNAT, which makes attempts to identify
alleged ByLock users using communications metadata exceptionally error
prone. In addition, individuals might have relied on 'Good Data'
practices - such as using a VPN, a proxy server or Tor - to hide their
IP addresses.[^07chapter7_88] This makes attribution of ByLock usage based on
communications metadata significantly unreliable. Furthermore, handing
down lengthy prison sentences to individuals based on such unreliable
metadata as evidence is likely to amount to a miscarriage of justice.

In their report scrutinizing the Bylock prosecutions and the legality of
actions of the Turkish state following the coup attempt, British
criminal lawyers Clegg and Baker illustrated four significant breaches
of the ECHR. First, alleged ByLock use does not satisfy the requirement
of the ECHR Article 5:1(c)\[reasonable suspicion of having committed and
offence\] and therefore, 'detention of persons on the basis that they
had downloaded the Bylock App use is arbitrary and in breach of Article
5 of the convention \[right to liberty and security\]'.[^07chapter7_89] Second, the
MIT report is a clear breach of Article 6(3)(d) \[right to examine or
have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and
examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as
witnesses against him\], because 'authors of \[the MIT\] report are not
identified' and 'no questions can be asked to the authors of the
report'.[^07chapter7_90] Third, mass dismissal and arrest of members of judiciary
'strikes at the heart of judicial independence and appears to be a
further clear breach of Article 6 \[the right to a fair trial\]'.[^07chapter7_91]
Lastly, since both membership of GM and use of the ByLock app was legal
before the coup attempt, to convict persons of membership of a terrorist
organization on alleged ByLock use is 'clearly retrospective criminality
and a clear breach of Article 7'.[^07chapter7_92] The Turkish regime's breaches of
the ECHR in the aftermath of the coup attempt - despite being a
signatory of the ECHR - demonstrates that supranational human rights
legislation may be ineffective to prevent metadata abuses by states. In
the context of unlawful access and metadata retention debates, this
means that 'broad mandatory \[meta\]data retention policies'[^07chapter7_93] and 'A
priori \[meta\]data retention or collection'[^07chapter7_94] capabilities of states
leave dissidents and political enemies of the states extremely
vulnerable.

## Lessons from the ByLock Case: Good Data Practices

In this chapter, by critically engaging with the ByLock prosecutions I
detailed the material effects of metadata exploitation for political
purposes outside of doctrinal analyses. This case study contributes to
the metadata retention and lawful access debates, demonstrating both how
existing capabilities of DCTs can be abused, and how extrajudicial -
even illegal - investigative techniques can be introduced to oppress
dissidents. Authoritarian governments like Turkey can and/or will take
advantage of moral panics following political upheavals. 'Bad data'
practices such as unlawful access and large-scale (meta)data retention
and (meta)data manipulation can be instrumental to confer criminality on
dissidents and political enemies, as observed in the ByLock case.
Although regimes frequently spy on and surveil dissidents and activists
in normal times, moral panics certainly help regimes to justify
unlawful, extrajudicial even illegal measures - such as criminalizing
encryption usage - that would have been harder to implement in normal
times.

Even though the scale and scope of mass arbitrary arrest of dissidents
in the ByLock prosecutions are unprecedented, the threat of (meta)data
abuse is not unique to dissidents in authoritarian regimes like Turkey.
As metadata are being collected in 'bulk' globally, the very
availability of metadata can be tempting for states to surveil
dissidents, minority populations, activists, whistleblowers and
government critics. On the other hand, although supranational human
rights legislation and supranational judicial mechanisms have provided a
degree of protection for human rights, their effectiveness in the face
of oppression is questionable. Despite being a signatory of ECHR and a
member of ECtHR, the Turkish regime has significantly breached the ECHR
without facing any significant repercussions since the failed coup
attempt. The mass human rights breaches observed in Turkey in the
aftermath of the coup attempt call the credibility of supranational
judicial mechanisms into question. Regimes can simply ignore or suspend
the supranational judicial legislation citing perceived or even imagined
national security concerns, as observed in the ByLock case. Given the
possibility of the further rise of more authoritarian regimes in
previously liberal countries, this case may be a grim precedent for
things to come.

The ByLock case illustrates how critical 'Good Data' principles and the
integrity of encrypted and secure communication channels are for 'Good
Democracy'. In the age of DCTs, in order to exercise fundamental human
rights - such as the freedom of speech, the freedom of political
thought, the freedom of religion, and the freedom of association -
strong and secure encrypted communications are essential. If we are not
mindful and do not uphold, promote and defend 'Good Data' principles -
whether they be more comprehensive and practical human rights
legislation or technological solutions such as encrypted communications
and anonymization tools - globally, regimes can and will compromise DCTs
for 'bad' purposes, and the consequences for dissidents and governments
critics are severe, as observed in the ByLock case. Therefore, we should
remember that the ultimate promise of the 'Good Data' principles are not
staying outside states' surveillance nets or communicating secretly; it
is democracy itself.

[^07chapter7_43]: Space precludes a lengthier explanation of the fallout between
    the GM and AKP, but a short summary is needed to provide context for
    the reader. Even before the coup attempt, the GM was under heavy
    state pressure in Turkey. Both AKP and GM are Islam-inspired
    organisations, but they have categorical differences in
    interpretation. While the AKP is a political party founded by
    Erdogan and his allies in 2001 which adheres to nationalism and
    political Islam, the GM is a civil society organisation founded in
    Turkey in the late 1960s by the now-US-based Islamic cleric
    Fethullah Gulen, which prefers a civil interpretation of Islam with
    an emphasis on education. In terms of supporters, AKP is the largest
    party in Turkey with half of the popular vote (roughly 23 out of 46
    million), the official number of GM sympathisers is unknown but
    estimates put it around 200,000-300,000. The GM used to run more
    than 2000 education facilities such as primary schools, high
    schools, and universities in Turkey, all of which have been
    confiscated by the AKP government. The GM runs more than a thousand
    education facilities outside Turkey in more than 100 countries.
    Despite being on good terms for nearly a decade since the AKP first
    won plurality in the 2002 legislative elections, the GM and AKP
    started diverging after 2012 over political disagreements. AKP
    accused GM of infiltrating state organs and forming a 'parallel
    state' i.e. having too many influential followers in state
    positions. The GM dismissed this criticism by arguing this was
    natural given that it provided good education to pupils in its
    institutions. When prosecutors in Istanbul opened Turkey's largest
    corruption investigations to date in late 2013, incriminating an
    Iranian-Turkish gold trader Reza Zarrab and Erdogan's son along with
    four cabinet ministers and their sons with credible evidence,
    Erdogan called the corruption investigation a 'judicial coup' and
    publicly declared GM as 'public enemy number one'. Media
    organisations affiliated with the GM ran stories defending the
    corruption probes and individuals representing GM started
    criticising AKP government vocally. From this point on, GM started
    facing a crackdown in Turkey. Just months before July 2016, the GM
    was declared a terrorist organisation by authorities and individuals
    allegedly linked to the movement started being arrested on terrorism
    charges.

[^07chapter7_84]: Turkish Minister of Science and Technology first argued to have
    identified 215,000 ByLock users in September 2016. Then, in April
    2017, AKP-linked media reported that the number of ByLock users had
    decreased to 102,000. In December 2017, Ankara Chief Prosecutor's
    Office announced over 11,000 misidentifications in ByLock lists,
    decreasing the final number to just over 90,000. Furthermore, the
    prosecution did not share digital data/evidence with defendants and
    their counsel. This led critics to suspect 'fabrication, alteration
    or corruption of the data' used in ByLock trials. See: The Arrested
    Lawyers Initiative report for an extensive summary.
